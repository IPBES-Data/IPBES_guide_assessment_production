<p>1. Introduction to IPBES</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world’s <em>biodiversity</em> generates a wide range of benefits to society, often termed <em>ecosystem services.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Many of these services are under threat due to unsustainable human practices. Policies for rectifying such practices often benefit from a legitimate and credible bridging of science and policy and the establishment of the confidence level of the knowledge at hand. This is why the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) was established in 2012, inspired by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA).</p>
<p>IPBES aims to strengthen the science-policy interface for biodiversity and ecosystem services in order to understand the dynamics in human-nature interactions. It does so by undertaking international assessments and promoting national ones; by catalysing knowledge generation; by promoting the development and use of policy support tools; and by undertaking and facilitating capacity building. It also does so by supporting international initiatives and strategies such as:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>• The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN General Assembly; and</p>
<p>• Those under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowledge on how biodiversity contributes to humanity is vital to achieve sustainable development. These contributions termed ecosystem services or nature’s contribution to people are maintained through policies for conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity. IPBES assesses ecosystem services through the lens of nature's contributions to people as anchored in the IPBES <em>Conceptual Framework</em> (CF). The framework models the interactions between people and nature, and presents scientific concepts and parallel notions from indigenous and local knowledge systems under inclusive new concepts (Diaz et. al., 2015). One of the key overarching inclusive concepts is "<em>nature’s contributions to people</em>" (NCP) (Pascual et. al., 2017). It includes and allows for the assessment of both the scientific concept of "ecosystem goods and services" and the notion of "nature's gifts" from indigenous and local knowledge systems. NCP can be beneficial or detrimental to people depending on the cultural context and is assessed from two mutually supportive perspectives: a generalizable and a contextual perspective. The generalizable perspective includes 18 NCP reporting categories organized in three partially overlapping groups: regulating, material and non-material contributions. The contextual perspective caters for the geographical and cultural specificities of indigenous and local knowledge systems. This inclusive approach allows for the reflection of a diverse range of scientific and social disciplines, perspectives and knowledge systems.</p>
<p>IPBES <em>critically evaluates the state of knowledge</em> on the interactions between human societies and the natural world.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> An IPBES assessment is initiated by the Plenary and performed by independent experts from multiple disciplines and from all regions of the world who contribute their time freely.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> These experts interact with government representatives and other stakeholders in a stepwise process to ensure legitimacy, relevance and credibility. IPBES synthesises and assesses available policy-relevant knowledge regarding biodiversity and its contributions to human well-being in response to requests from governments and other stakeholders. These assessments include a summary for policymakers (SPM), consisting of policy relevant key messages drawn from a report made of detailed technical chapters. The assessment relies on financial and in-kind contributions from governments, experts and partners according to the institutional arrangements and agreed norms.</p>
<p>This Guide aims to help address conceptual, procedural and practical aspects of the IPBES assessments at all scales, and to promote consistency across different scales.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The Guide serves as a ‘Roadmap’ and focuses on key elements assessment practitioners may want to take into account when undertaking an assessment within the context of IPBES.</p>
<p>The Guide has been developed for experts who are taking part in assessments approved under IPBES, be they thematic, methodological or general assessments of biodiversity and ecosystems at global, regional and sub-regional levels. The Guide is also meant to assist those who might want to undertake IPBES inspired assessments at sub-regional, national and local levels and to help ensure that such assessments are compatible with larger scale IPBES completed assessments.</p>
<p>1.1 What is an IPBES assessment?</p>
<p>IPBES assessments synthesize and critically evaluate peer-reviewed scientific literature, grey literature and other available knowledge, such as indigenous and local knowledge. The assessments include a review and synthesis, as well as an analysis and an expert judgement of available knowledge. Experts are guided in this work by a conceptual framework outlining the interaction between people and nature and by guidance on the conceptualization of values of biodiversity and nature's contributions to people. An assessment does not involve the undertaking of new primary research but may include re‑analysis of data and models to address specific questions. Findings should be policy relevant but not policy-prescriptive. They could feed into and be guided by the work on policy support tools and methodologies, including its catalogue.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>IPBES assessments need to be credible, legitimate and relevant. They typically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Involve governments and other stakeholders</strong> in the initiation, scoping, review and adoption of the assessment reports (this involvement promotes credibility, legitimacy and relevance at policy level);</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operate through an open and transparent process</strong>, run by a group of experts that has a balance of disciplines, geography and gender, and who use agreed conceptual frameworks, methodologies and support tools, as well as are subject to independent peer review (this process promotes credibility, legitimacy and relevance at scientific level); and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Present findings and knowledge gaps</strong> that are policy relevant but not policy prescriptive, where the level of confidence and the range of available views are presented in an unbiased way (this approach promotes relevance at both scientific and policy level).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>IPBES assessments not only focus on what is known, but also on what is currently uncertain. Assessments play an important role in guiding policy through identifying areas of broad scientific agreement as well as areas of scientific uncertainty that may need further research.</p>
<p>IPBES may undertake different types of assessments at sub-regional, regional and global levels. It also encourages and helps catalyse other assessments at lower scales, such as those with a local, national and a more limited sub-regional scope. IPBES is currently engaged in, has undertaken or has planned to undertake the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Global assessments</strong> to assess biodiversity and ecosystem services and their interlinkages at the global scales. The global assessments will draw upon the work undertaken by the regional assessments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regional assessments</strong> to assess biodiversity and ecosystem services and their interlinkages at the regional and, as necessary, sub-regional levels (e.g., Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia). Regional assessments will provide the building blocks for the global assessments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thematic assessments</strong> to assess a particular theme at an appropriate scale or a new topic (e.g., assessments of pollinators, pollination and food production, land degradation and restoration, invasive alien species and their control, and sustainable use).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methodological assessments</strong> to assess the availability and use of methods in relation with a specific topic (e.g., values, scenarios and models) so that these methods can then be used in IPBES assessments and other activities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1.2 What are the operating principles, functions and rules followed by IPBES?</p>
<p>IPBES is defined by a set of operating principles and functions, and is implemented thanks to institutional arrangements, procedure programmes and other resources, as set out in Box 1.1.</p>

<p>1.3 How to use this Guide</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This Assessment Guide is aimed at those who are involved in an IPBES assessment, such as co‑chairs, authors, review editors and members of the technical support units (TSUs).</strong> The core part of the Guide sets out the four stages of an IPBES assessment and their different steps. It then sets out the roles and responsibilities of the different actors involved in an assessment. Additionally, guidance is provided on developing an SPM and on using confidence terms. The Guide is supported by a series of modules (see Box 1.2), which contain further information for those involved in IPBES assessments, and other resources such as webinars, e-learning modules, and the IPBES Catalogue for Policy Support Tools and Methodologies (see Box 1.3).</p>

<h1>2. The IPBES assessment process</h1>
<p>An IPBES assessment report is the result of a staged process designed to produce an enhanced understanding of knowledge needs and policy opportunities among actors in science and policy. This chapter presents the different stages involved in performing an IPBES assessment (see Figure 2.1).</p>

</ol>
<p>2.1 Stage 1: Requests and scope</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An assessment begins upon receiving a request from a government (or when receiving inputs and suggestions from a stakeholder), which is then considered by the Plenary. The procedure for receiving and prioritizing requests represents the first stage in defining a new work programme. It has taken place once so far, in order to define the first work programme of IPBES, for 2014-2018. A new call for requests will take place towards the end of each work programme. The first set of requests led the Plenary to carry out a set of thematic, methodological and regional assessments, as well as a global assessment.</p>
<p><em>Note: The mechanism described in the following section was used for the production of the first work programme. The Plenary may decide, when building the second IPBES work programme, to make a number of adjustments based on lessons learnt. This means that some of the steps described below might be modified as lessons are learnt.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.1.1 Requests by members and observers</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The first stage in the IPBES assessment process is for requests, inputs and suggestions to be submitted to the IPBES Secretariat no later than six months before an IPBES Plenary.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Submissions should include information on:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The relevance of the objective, function and work programme of the Platform;</p></li>
<li><p>The urgency of action in light of imminent risks caused by issues addressed in the action;</p></li>
<li><p>The relevance of the requested action in addressing specific policies or processes;</p></li>
<li><p>The geographic scope of the requested action, as well as issues to be covered by such action;</p></li>
<li><p>The anticipated level of complexity of the issues to be addressed by the requested action;</p></li>
<li><p>Any previous work and existing initiatives of a similar nature and evidence of remaining gaps, such as the absence or limited availability of information and tools to address the issues, and reasons why the Platform is best suited to take action;</p></li>
<li><p>The availability of scientific literature and expertise for the Platform to undertake the requested action;</p></li>
<li><p>The scale of the potential impacts and the potential beneficiaries of the requested action;</p></li>
<li><p>The requirements for financial and human resources, and the potential duration of the requested action; and</p></li>
<li><p>An identification of priorities within the multiple submitted requests.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The list of requests, inputs and suggestions are compiled by the IPBES secretariat for prioritization by the Multidisciplinary Expert Panel (MEP) in consultation with the Bureau. The MEP will then produce a report for consideration by the Plenary, also depicting how the assessments will be integrated into the IPBES work programme.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Consideration by the MEP and Bureau</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As part of the preliminary evaluation and prioritization process, the MEP and Bureau will undertake an initial scoping of an assessment, including examining feasibility and estimated costs. This initial scoping study may also contain pre-scoping material, usually provided by the body making the original request for the assessment. Using this information, the MEP, in conjunction with the Bureau, will prepare a report containing a prioritized list of requested assessments to be submitted to the Plenary. The report will contain an analysis of the scientific and policy relevance of the requests, including the implication of the requests for the Platform’s work programme and resources requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.1.3 Consideration by the Plenary</p>
<p>The Plenary has two options to consider: approve the scoping report and initiate the assessment (based on an initial scoping by the MEP) or request a detailed scoping. Initiation of the assessment can go ahead without the detailed scoping study and proceed to the second stage of the assessment process without the Plenary needing to consider the outcome of a more detailed scoping exercise (see option B, Figure 2.2). In a majority of cases, the Plenary will request a detailed scoping before agreeing to undertake an assessment (See option A, Figure 2.2). The Plenary may delay the start of the second stage or initiate the assessment immediately based on the Scoping Report.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>2.1.4 Scoping by the MEP, Bureau and experts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Plenary decides to proceed with detailed scoping of an assessment then a call for nomination of experts to assist in the scoping process is made (see Figure 2.2). A detailed scoping document, overseen by the MEP and Bureau, is developed by a group of experts. Typically, a meeting is convened where the scoping document is developed. An electronic consultation can also take place with experts self-selecting themselves to participate.</p>
<p>A detailed scoping document will usually consist of the following information:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The scope (including policy relevant questions);</p></li>
<li><p>Geographic boundaries of the assessment (if relevant);</p></li>
<li><p>The rationale (including the potential impact of the assessment);</p></li>
<li><p>The assessment’s utility (including who the end users of the assessments are);</p></li>
<li><p>Assumptions;</p></li>
<li><p>Methodological approaches;</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter outlines (including a short paragraph on the potential content for each chapter);</p></li>
<li><p>Key datasets (this is not an exhaustive list but rather key datasets which should be mobilized);</p></li>
<li><p>Strategic partnerships and initiatives (this is not an exhaustive list but could either highlight the types of partnerships which will be required to deliver the assessment or include a short list key partners);</p></li>
<li><p>The operational structure (including if a technical support unit will be required);</p></li>
<li><p>The process and timetable;</p></li>
<li><p>A cost estimate;</p></li>
<li><p>Communication and outreach; and</p></li>
<li><p>Capacity-building (highlights what capacity may be needed to undertake the assessment).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Members and other stakeholders of IPBES can then be invited to review and comment on the draft detailed scoping report. Based on the results of the detailed scoping exercise and comments received from members of the Platform and other stakeholders, the MEP, in consultation with the Bureau, then decides whether to proceed with the submission of the scoping report to the Plenary.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>2.1.5 Consideration by the Plenary</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once finalized, the draft detailed scoping document is presented to the Plenary, who examines it paragraph by paragraph. The Plenary can then decide between the following options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Approve the assessment and request its undertaking (including related budget and timeline).</p></li>
<li><p>Approve the assessment but delay its undertaking.</p></li>
<li><p>Not approve and request further scoping.</p></li>
<li><p>Not approve.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>2.2 Stage 2: Expert evaluation of the state of knowledge</p>
<p>2.2.1 Nomination of experts by members and observers, and selection by the MEP</p>
<p>The Rules of Procedure for IPBES set out the nomination process for the different roles within an IPBES assessment (see IPBES/2/17 and decision IPBES-4/3)<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and are summarized in Table 1. The chair of IPBES, following the Plenary which requested the undertaking of an assessment, issues a call for nominations, explaining some of the requirements, particularly in terms of disciplines to cover all chapters of the assessment. Governments and observers are invited to nominate independent experts and fellows. From the nominations received, the MEP will select the report co-chairs, coordinating lead authors (CLA), lead authors (LA) and review editors (RE). The MEP will take the following into consideration when making these selections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>80% of the selected experts should be nominated by governments and 20% by an organization.</p></li>
<li><p>The selection should reflect a range of scientific, technical and socio-economic views and expertise (e.g., natural and social sciences, scholars from the humanities, knowledge holders and experts in indigenous and local knowledge (ILK)).</p></li>
<li><p>The selection should have a good geographic representation, with appropriate representation of experts from developing and developed countries and countries with economies in transition.</p></li>
<li><p>The diversity of knowledge systems (including indigenous and local knowledge) should be represented.</p></li>
<li><p>The selection should aim at reaching gender balance.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While every effort should be made to engage experts on the author teams from the relevant regions, with regards to chapters or assessments that deal with those specific regions, experts from other regions can be engaged if they can provide an important contribution to the assessment. If gaps in geographical, gender and expertise balances are identified, the co-chairs of the assessments, together with their respective CLAs, can identify potential additional experts to fill in these gaps. These experts will then be retroactively nominated following the approved procedure for <strong>filling gaps</strong> among groups of experts approved by the fourth session of the Plenary (see IPBES/4/19 and decision IPBES-4/3).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>MEP or Bureau members that would like to participate as an expert in an assessment can be nominated for such a role, but they will have to resign from their duties as an MEP or Bureau member when accepting the new role.</p>
<p>The co-chairs, CLAs, LAs, REs, Fellows and Contributing Authors (CAs) have different responsibilities within a particular IPBES assessment. Each role in an Assessments not only has a specific nomination process but also has different responsibilities within a particular IPBES assessment (see Table 2.1). These roles are further described in Table 2.2.</p>

<p>The review editors’ main tasks are: (i) to assist the MEP in identifying reviewers for the expert review process; (ii) ensure that all substantive expert and government review comments are afforded appropriate consideration; (iii) advise lead authors on how to handle contentious or controversial issues; and (iv) ensure that genuine controversies are adequately reflected in the text of the report concerned.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the final text of the report remains with the relevant CLAs and LAs.</p>
<p>Review editors must submit a written report to the MEP and, where appropriate, will be requested to attend a meeting convened by the MEP to communicate their findings from the review process and assist in finalizing summaries for policymakers and synthesis reports.

<ul>
<li><p>Discuss the problems and actions first. Any necessary background can come later in an appendix or in references to other sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on definable measures/actions and avoid the passive voice. For example, policy professionals are likely to ignore statements like “there are reasons to believe some trends can be slowed or even reversed”. If there are some opportunities for reversal, state precisely what we believe they are to the best of our knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Statements like “...might have enormous ramifications for health and productivity...” may seem to be strong because of the word “enormous”, but they are actually politically impotent because of the word “might.” If data are used in the assessment, what do they say about what “is” happening? What can we recommend, based on the best available knowledge, about what actions would be effective?</p></li>
<li><p>A statements like “there is a long history of concern over the environmental effects of fishing in coastal habitats, but the vast scope of ecological degradation is only recently becoming apparent (citation)” is a case where something strong could be said but it is weakened by putting emphasis on the late arrival of this information and knowledge “becoming apparent”. It does not matter so much when the degradation was discovered, what matters is that it was. Cite the source and say “fishing practices are causing wide‑spread destruction”.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use value-laden, flowery or colloquial language (e.g., “sleeping dragon”, “elephant in the room”, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Statements like “we do not yet have clear guidelines for achieving responsible, effective management of natural resources” could result in a legitimate policy response of “OK, so we’ll wait until we do”. Instead, the statement could be changed to recommend what needs to be done, such as, “if clear guidelines were developed, then...”.</p></li>

<p>2.2.2 Conflicts of interest</p>
<p>IPBES has put in place conflict of interest policy and implementation procedures to ensure that attention is paid to issues of independence and bias in order for there to be public confidence in the product and processes of IPBES.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> IPBES defines conflicts of interest and bias as any circumstances that could lead a reasonable person to either question an individual’s objectivity or believe an unfair advantage has been created. The policy further sets out the difference between conflicts of interest and bias along with rules on how the policy should be applied when including the Committee of Conflicts of Interest. Within an IPBES assessment, all co-chairs, CLAs, LAs, REs, fellows and TSU members must sign a conflict of interest form.</p>
<p>2.2.3 Assessment by experts</p>
<p>A majority of IPBES assessments will be undertaken over three years (see Figure 2.3) and the timeline for each assessment is agreed by the Plenary as part of the acceptance of the scoping report for the assessment.</p>
<p>The evaluation is undertaken by a geographically and gender balanced multidisciplinary group of independent experts selected on their credentials from among a group of nominees. Their interaction with government representatives, observers and stakeholders takes place at the initiation, scoping, reviewing and approval stages of the assessment.</p>
<p>Typically, an IPBES assessment process will consist of the development of different drafts of the technical report:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Annotated outline</p></li>
<li><p>Zero order draft</p></li>
<li><p>First order draft (1<sup>st</sup> order draft)</p></li>
<li><p>Second order draft (2<sup>nd</sup> order draft)</p></li>
<li><p>Final draft</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The development of these drafts, including the executive summaries of the chapters and the SPM, follows the chapter outline and addresses the guidance and questions set out in the approved scoping report. This process is usually supported by three author meetings and different review periods before being presented for discussion at the Plenary (see Figure 2.3). It involves an iterative and collective expert evaluation of the state of knowledge, which entails the preparation and review of the following successive draft chapters and summaries.</p>

<p>2.2.4 Peer review process</p>
<p>Within an IPBES assessment there are two external review processes:</p>
<p>1. Independent external peer review of the first order draft:<br>
Experts with relevant knowledge and credentials regarding the assessment, but not involved in the assessment, will be invited to critically review one or more chapters of the first order draft.</p>
<p>2. Independent external peer review, review by governments and other stakeholders:<br>
Governments, observers and any interested external expert can provide comments on the second order draft and the first order draft of the SPM.</p>
<p>IPBES has three governing principles for their review process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong><em>Provide expert advice</em>:</strong><br>
Seek the best scientific and technical guidance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Ensure comprehensive independent representation:</em></strong><br>
Invite responses from all countries and stakeholder groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Follow a transparent and open process</em>:</strong><br>
Make all comments and author responses received available online.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Chair of the secretariat will issue a call for external comments and the draft chapters will be placed online in a password protected area. Experts, governments and stakeholders willing to make comments will register and commit to keep the documents confidential before receiving the texts for review. Review comments are submitted to the relevant assessment technical support units using a standard format (see Table 2.4). This allows for comments to be easily attributed to sections, pages and lines of the text and can be dealt with in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>2.2.5 Developing executive summaries for chapters of an assessment report</p>
<p>An executive summary is, in principle, located at the start of each chapter to outline its key findings.</p>
<p>These summaries are crucial to communicate the outcomes of the assessment to its primary audience: members of IPBES, governments, observers and all other stakeholders. The executive summaries also provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>confidence statements in support of each key finding (see section 2.3.6);</p></li>
<li><p>links to sections in the full chapters that contain relevant supporting evidence and literature (traceability of findings);</p></li>
<li><p>input to the SPM; and</p></li>
<li><p>an explicit link between the SPM key findings and the sections within the full technical report providing supporting evidence (a traceable, evidence ‘paper trail’).</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The SPMs need to be written clearly, concisely and using simple language. This will facilitate effective communication of the key findings. Executive summaries are technical in nature and are based on the analysis set out in the chapter. They are not the same as an abstract of a scientific paper, but they should be a synthesis analysis and collective expert judgement of the chapter’s findings. One of the key differences between the executive summaries and the SPM is moving from setting out the technical facts to blending and synthesizing the findings from different chapters into policy-relevant messages. A key finding in the SPM should be readily traceable back to a main finding(s) in an executive summary that in turn should be readily traceable back to a section(s) of the chapter text, which should be traceable, where appropriate, to the primary literature through references. References to the relevant executive summary statement within the SPM are included in curly brackets (e.g., {1.2}), see Box 2.2 for examples.</p>

<p>2.2.6 Using confidence terms</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When we talk about confidence in assessments in relation to knowledge, we are referring to how assured experts are about the findings (data and information) presented within their chapters. Low confidence describes a situation where we have incomplete knowledge and therefore cannot fully explain an outcome or reliably predict a future outcome, whereas high confidence conveys that we have extensive knowledge and are able to explain an outcome or predict a future outcome with much greater certainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.2.6.1 Why does our communication of confidence matter in IPBES assessments?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Knowledge and scientific data about the natural world and the influence of human activities are complex. There is a need to communicate what the assessment author teams have high confidence in as well as what requires further investigation to allow decision-makers to make informed decisions. Furthermore, by following a common approach when applying confidence terminology within an assessment, authors are able to increase consistency and transparency.</p>
<p>IPBES assessments will use specific phrases known as “confidence terms” in order to ensure consistency in the communication of confidence by author teams. What confidence term is used will depend on the author team’s expert judgement on the quantity and quality of the supporting evidence and the level of scientific agreement. IPBES assessments use a four-box model of confidence (see Figure 2.5) based on evidence and agreements that give four main confidence terms: “well established” (much evidence and high agreement), “unresolved” (much evidence but low agreement), “established but incomplete” (limited evidence but good agreement) and “inconclusive” (limited or no evidence and little agreement).</p>
<p>The following guidance will discuss where confidence terms must be applied in the IPBES assessment reports, how to select the appropriate term to communicate the author team’s confidence and how to present the confidence terms in the text.</p>
<p>Confidence terms should always be used in two key parts of an assessment:</p>

<p>2.2.6.2 How to do I select confidence terms?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Once the author team has identified the chapter’s key messages and findings, in order to present these in the <strong>executive summary</strong> or <strong>SPM</strong>, it is mandatory to evaluate the quality and quantity of associated evidence and scientific agreement. Author teams will always be required to make qualitative <strong>assessments</strong> of confidence based on expert estimates of agreements and evidence.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the evidence supporting the key message or finding, <strong>quantitative assessments</strong> of confidence may also be possible. Quantitative assessments of confidence are estimates of the likelihood (probability) that a well-defined outcome will occur in the future. Probabilistic estimates are based on statistical analyses of observations or model results, or both, combined with expert judgment. However, it may be that quantitative assessments of confidence are not possible in all assessments due to the nature of the evidence available.</p>
<p>It is not mandatory to apply confidence terms throughout the main text of the assessment report. However, in some parts of the main text, in areas where there are a range of views that need to be described, confidence terms may be applied where considered appropriate by the author team. In order to avoid confusing readers, in no case should the terms be used colloquially or casually. Use these terms if you have followed the recommended steps for assessing confidence.</p>

<p>2.2.6.3 Qualitative assessment of confidence</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This section discusses the process and language that all author teams must apply to evaluate and communicate confidence qualitatively. The following factors should be considered to evaluate the validity of the message or finding: the type, quantity, quality and consistency of evidence (the existing peer‑reviewed literature and grey literature, etc.), as well as the level of agreement (the level of concurrence in the data, literature and amongst experts, not just across the author team). The author team’s expert judgement on the level of evidence and agreement should then be used to apply a confidence term as described in Figure 2.4:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Inconclusive</em></strong> – existing as or based on a suggestion or speculation; no or limited evidence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Unresolved</em></strong> – multiple independent studies exist but conclusions do not agree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Established but incomplete</em></strong> – general agreement although only a limited number of studies exist but with no comprehensive synthesis, or the studies that do exist imprecisely address the question.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Well established</em></strong> – comprehensive meta-analysis or other syntheses/multiple independent studies that agree.</p></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The <strong><em>well-established</em></strong> box in Figure 2.4 may be further subdivided in order to give author teams the flexibility to emphasize key messages and findings that the author team have very high confidence in:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Very well established</em></strong> – very comprehensive evidence base and very low amount of disagreement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Virtually certain</em></strong> – very robust data covering multiple temporal and spatial scales and almost no disagreement.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The qualitative confidence terms discussed in this section should not be interpreted probabilistically and are distinct from “statistical significance”.</p>
<p><strong><em>Virtually certain</em></strong> will not be used by the author teams frequently in the assessment report. The confidence terms used to communicate high confidence are intended to provide authors with the flexibility to emphasize issues that may be considered as fact by the scientific community but not by the non-scientific community (decision-makers, media and the general public). In most cases it may be appropriate to describe these findings using overwhelming evidence and agreements as statements of fact without using confidence qualifiers.</p>
<p>Similarly, <strong><em>inconclusive</em></strong> may also be used infrequently, but is intended to provide authors with the flexibility to emphasize issues that are not established in science but that are important to policymakers or might have been highlighted by a different audience.</p>
<p>The degree of confidence in findings that are conditional on other findings should be evaluated and reported separately.</p>
<p>When evaluating the levels of evidence and agreements for a statement, it is important to standardize the use of the terms within and across the author teams and, when possible, across the assessment in order to ensure their consistent use. The use of the discussed confidence terms can be standardized by taking key messages and findings in the <strong>executive summaries</strong> and discussing, as an author team, what terms should be applied and the reasons why. When appropriate, consider using formal elicitation methods to organize and quantify the selection of confidence terms.</p>
<p>Be aware of the tendency for a group to converge on an expressed view and become overconfident in it. One method to avoid this would be to ask each member of the author team to write down his or her individual assessment of the level of confidence before entering into a group discussion. If this is not done before a group discussion, important views and ranges of confidence may be inadequately discussed and assessed. It is important to recognize when individual views are adjusting as a result of group interactions and allow adequate time for such changes in viewpoint to be reviewed (Mastrandrea et al. 2010). Whichever approach is taken, traceable accounts should be produced and recorded to demonstrate how confidence was evaluated.</p>
<p>It is important to carefully consider how the sentences in the key messages and findings are structured because it will influence the clarity with which we communicate our understanding of the level of confidence. For example, sometimes the key finding combines an element that is <strong><em>well-established</em></strong> with one that is <strong><em>established but incomplete</em></strong>. In this case it can be helpful to arrange the phrasing so that the <strong><em>well-established</em></strong> element comes first and the <strong><em>established but incomplete</em></strong> element comes second, or as a separate sentence. Avoid the use of <strong><em>unresolved</em></strong> and <strong><em>established but incomplete</em></strong> where possible by writing or rewording key messages and findings in terms of what is known rather than unknown. Author teams should focus on presenting what is <strong><em>well-established</em></strong> as far as possible in order to make it clear to decision-makers what is known. Assigning confidence terms to our key findings will therefore often require that we re-write sentences, rather than simply adding the terms to existing text.</p>

<p>2.2.6.4 Quantitative assessment of confidence</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This section discusses the process and language that author teams may wish to apply in order to evaluate and communicate the confidence that an outcome will occur quantitatively. Likelihood expresses a probabilistic estimate of the occurrence of a single event or of an outcome within a given range. Probabilistic estimates are based on statistical analyses of observations or model results, or both, combined with expert judgment.</p>
<p>When sufficient probabilistic information is available, consider ranges of outcomes and their associated probabilities with attention to outcomes of potential high consequence. The author team’s expert judgement on the magnitude of the probability should then be used to apply a likelihood term (see Figure 2.5).</p>

Note: Extreme levels of probability are nested within the broader levels of “likely” and “unlikely”.<br>
<em>Source: modified from Mastrandrea et al.&nbsp;2010.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Categories in Figure 2.5 can be considered to have nested boundaries. For example, describing an outcome as <strong><em>likely</em></strong> or <strong><em>very likely</em></strong> conveys in both cases that the probability of this outcome could fall within the range of 95% to 100% probability. However, in the case of <strong><em>likely</em></strong>, the larger range (66-100%) indicates a higher degree of confidence than <strong><em>very likely</em></strong> (90-100%). In making their expert judgement, author teams should start at <strong><em>about as likely as not</em></strong> and consider whether there is sufficient quantitative information available to assign either a <strong><em>likely</em></strong> or <strong><em>unlikely</em></strong> probability range. Only after thinking about this initial range should the author teams consider whether there is sufficient evidence to move to more extreme levels of probability.</p>
<p>Author teams should note that using a likelihood term for a specific outcome implies that alternative outcomes have the inverse likelihood, e.g., if an outcome is <strong><em>likely</em></strong> (a range of 66-100%) then that would imply that other outcomes are <strong><em>unlikely</em></strong> (0-33% probability).</p>
<p>If the author team consider that sufficiently robust information is available with which to make a ‘best estimate’ of the probability of the occurrence of an event, then it is preferable to specify the full probability range (e.g., 90-95%) in the text without using the terms in Figure 2.5. Also, <strong><em>about as likely as not</em></strong> should not be used to communicate a lack of knowledge, only as an estimate of probability based on the available information.</p>
<p>Author teams should be aware of the way in which key messages and findings are phrased. The way in which a statement is framed will have an effect on how it is interpreted, e.g., a 10% chance of dying is interpreted more negatively than a 90% chance of surviving. Consider reciprocal statements to avoid value-laden interpretations, e.g., report chances of both dying and surviving (Mastrandrea et al.&nbsp;2010).</p>
<p>Finally, author teams should try not to avoid controversial events, such as impacts or events with high consequence but extremely low probability, in their effort to achieve consensus within an author team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.2.6.5 How to present confidence terms:presenting confidence using the four-box model</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Confidence terms are communicated as part of the key findings of an assessment. The key findings are set out in the <strong>executive summaries</strong> for each of the assessment’s chapters in the full technical report. The key findings are the facts and information drawn directly from the chapter. It is recommended that key findings should be set out as follows.</p>
<p><strong>The first sentence of the finding should be bolded</strong> and contain a confidence term from the four-box model in italics and brackets at the end of the sentence. This first sentence is followed by two to four sentences which then supports the information contained in this first sentence. Subsequent sentences may contain confidence terms within brackets where appropriate. It is not necessary to include confidence terms with each sentence if the whole paragraph falls under the same confidence term.</p>
<p>The words that make up the four-box model and likelihood scale should <u>not</u> be used in the text of the assessment except when formally assigning confidence. If, for example, there was a sentence that used the word “likely” but not with the intended meaning from the likelihood scale, then the word should be replaced with another (e.g., probably).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.2.6.6 Presenting confidence using the likelihood scale</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In some instances, author teams may wish to complement the use of the <strong><em>well-established</em></strong> confidence term with a term from the likelihood scale. If terms from the likelihood scale are used then they should be incorporated into the text and italicized prior to the impact or outcome of the probability of which they are describing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.2.6.7 Traceability</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The author team’s expert judgment of their confidence in the key messages and findings should be explained by providing a clear traceable account. A traceable account is a description in the chapter of the evaluation of the type, quantity, quality and consistency of the evidence and level of agreement that forms the basis for the given key message or finding (Mastrandrea et al.&nbsp;2010). Where possible, the description should identify and discuss the sources of confidence. In order to ensure consistency in how the author teams classify sources of confidence within and across IPBES assessments, author teams should use the typology shown in Table 2.5.</p>
<p>A main finding in the <strong>summary for policymakers</strong> should be readily traceable back to an <strong>executive summary</strong> main finding(s) that in turn should be readily traceable back to a section(s) of the chapter text, which should be traceable, where appropriate, to the primary literature through references.</p>
<p>References to the relevant <strong>executive summary</strong> statement in the SPM should be included in curly brackets (e.g., {1.2}), see Box 2.2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.2.6.8 Summary of the steps for applying confidence terms</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The steps recommended for assessing and communicating confidence for executive summaries and SPMs is as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Identify the chapter’s key messages and findings.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the supporting evidence and the level of scientific agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish whether the evidence is probabilistic or not (e.g., from model predictions).</p></li>
<li><p>Where the evidence is qualitative instead or probabilistic, select a confidence term from the <strong>four-box model</strong> (see Figure 2.4) to communicate the author team’s confidence in the key message or finding.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Assess the quantity and quality of evidence and the level of agreement in the scientific community.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish how confident the author team is and select the appropriate term.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Where quantitative estimates of the probability of an outcome or impact occurring are available (e.g., from model predictions), select a likelihood term from the <strong>likelihood scale</strong> (see Table 2.5) to communicate the author teams’ expert judgement of the range of the probability of occurrence.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that there is always a ‘traceable account’ in the main text describing how the author team adopted the specific level of confidence, including the important lines of evidence used, the standard of evidence applied and the approaches to combine/reconcile multiple lines of evidence. Where specific sources of confidence are prominent for a key finding, the terms used in the left-hand column of Table 2.5 should be included in the traceable account.</p></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>2.2.7.1 What is a summary for policymakers?</p>
<p>A summary for policymakers (SPM) is a short document that highlights the main messages of an assessment responding to its scoping report in a synthesized and less technical language, and tailored to the needs of policymakers. It consists of preferably 15-20 top key messages (2,000 words max) categorized under a few headings and presented without reference to the main chapters. They represent the highest level of synthesis of the assessment and may be structured differently from the set of main findings in the SPM. Each message is carefully formulated in a bolded sentence with assigned confidence levels and is supported by a paragraph of non-bolded text which substantiates the message (see Box 2.4).</p>

<p>2.2.7.2 Steps to developing an SPM</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Step 1: Developing executive summaries</em></p>
<p>The first step in developing an SPM is the development of an executive summary for each chapter. The executive summaries set out the key findings with the appropriate confidence terms for a particular chapter (see section 2.2.6.8 for further guidance on applying confidence terms). The content of the executive summary should be technical in nature and based on the analysis set out in the chapter.</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Identify the policy-relevant messages</em></p>
<p>One of the key differences between the executive summaries and the SPM is moving from the process of setting out technical facts to blending and synthesizing the findings from different chapters into policy-relevant messages. These messages aim to tell a short, coherent and compelling story on the state of knowledge (see Box 2.5).</p>
<p>This stage is critical for fine-tuning the articulation of key findings and policy-relevant messages in the SPM, developing graphics, quality assurance of chapters, and ensuring consistency and traceability of confidence statements between the SPM and chapters. The drafts are process‑validated by the MEP and Bureau and are presented by the secretariat to the Plenary during Stage 3 – approval and acceptance of the final assessment report.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The SPM for the IPBES assessments are approved line by line within the Plenary, therefore it is important to develop a succinct summary based upon the analysis of the assessment. Use confidence terminology to ensure that no ambiguity appears with regards to the messages and analyses in the SPM. Each finding should also contain a footnote with a reference back to the number of the section or sections of the main report that the finding is drawn from.</p>

<p>2.3.1 Acceptance of reports by the Plenary</p>
<p>An assessment report is comprised of an SPM, which the Plenary will approve line by line, and a set of chapters (sometimes referred to as the technical report), which only the Plenary will accept.

After ‘acceptance’ by the Plenary, chapters are edited by the authors to reflect the changes made by the Plenary to the SPM, and thus ensure full consistency between the SPM and the underlying chapters and their executive summaries. Reports accepted by the Plenary will then be formally and prominently described on the front, and on other introductory covers, as a report accepted by IPBES.</p>
<p>2.3.2 Approval of SPM by the Plenary</p>
<p>The SPMs are normally discussed line by line in a contact group.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> It is then presented to the Plenary for consideration and approval in the presence of the co-chairs and some of the experts of the assessment, who will be able to address the questions of the Plenary and discuss whether proposed changes are compatible with the science contained in the report. Sessions of the Plenary where SPMs are being discussed are open to observers but are closed to the media, including social media.</p>
<p>The key actors in this stage are:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Governments, who through their representatives consider the drafts in dialogue with each other and the assessment experts and observers at the Plenary;</p></li>
<li><p>Members of the Bureau who co-chair the contact groups under the Plenary where the drafts are considered;</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment co-chairs and CLAs who are present on the podium to explain and defend the scientific basis for the findings and provide scientific clarification and advice on any reformulation of the findings under consideration; and</p></li>
<li><p>the IPBES chair who chairs the Plenary.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The SPM will then be formally and prominently described as a report of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.</p>

<p>2.4 Stage 4: Use of the assessment findings</p>
<p>2.4.1 Outreach and support for use</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The release of the assessment report, including the front matter (preface), the SPM, the chapters and the back matter (annexes), is supported by a communication strategy. The communication strategy will be developed by the assessment management committee and approved by the Bureau. The aim of the communication strategy is to ensure that the assessment results are appropriately communicated and that they reach the target audiences.</p>
<p>The communication strategy may include the following steps:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Selection and hiring of a media consultants to assist with the implementation of the strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>Identification of the main target audiences related to the assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>Finalization of the communication strategy for the assessment with the media consultant, taking into account the IPBES communication, outreach and stakeholder engagement strategy and the needs of the relevant target audiences and stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>Communication ahead of the Plenary session where the SPM will be accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>Preparation of press releases.</p></li>
<li><p>Preparation of other media materials (including press kits, mini videos explaining the SPM content and PowerPoint presentations on the outcomes of the assessment).</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>Mobilization of all partners and stakeholders to help promote the assessment reports and expand their overall reach and impact.</p></li>
<li><p>Webinar with key journalists ahead of the Plenary.</p></li>
<li><p>Outreach with social media.</p></li>
<li><p>Media training for IPBES authors, as well as selected MEP, Bureau and secretariat staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Communication during the Plenary.</p></li>
<li><p>Press conference to announce the approval of the SPM.</p></li>
<li><p>Interviews with press, TV and radio in response to requests.</p></li>
<li><p>Communication after the Plenary.</p></li>
<li><p>Publication of printed versions of the SPM and technical reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional press conferences as appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>Media monitoring and follow-up.</p></li>
<li><p>Engagement over the course of the year with different audiences and stakeholders following the approval of the SPM, including conference and events.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>IPBES uses embargoed releases and interviews prior to the launch of the SPM as a means to ensure a disciplined approach to the dissemination of its key messages and findings. This approach is implemented after the approval of the SPMs by member States.</p>
<p>The Platform’s key strategic objectives at the launch of an assessment, which is a period of heightened activity, are first to maintain vigorous, accurate and sustained press coverage; second, to coordinate and control messaging that is kept strictly within the bounds set for the Platform’s reports, namely that they should be policy relevant, not policy prescriptive; and third, to meet the requests made by end users – policymakers and scientific and technical experts in government and the private sector in particular – for the conduct of seminars, briefings and meetings.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Communicating the results of the Platform’s assessments will be a challenging task because of the range and complexity of scientific issues and the increasing need to reach audiences beyond scientists and governments. With the help of a communications consulting firm, clear messages can be crafted for different audiences. Furthermore, trained science writers can translate technical language into text suitable for mass communication or can design web pages that explain scientific concepts to audiences without misconstruing or distorting the evidence underpinning those concepts.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The presentation of the findings of the assessment reports, in particular the launch of the Pollination Assessment, led to very intense press activity with articles appearing on all major newswires (Reuters, AFP, EFE, etc.), 1,200 online news articles in 25 languages across 80 countries, plus numerous articles in print newspapers (e.g., NY times) and abundant radio coverage. “Jeopardy”, a long-running US TV game show with an average daily audience of nine million, also included a question based on the IPBES report in its April 26, 2016 broadcast (category: “Science Update”). A table summarizing all of these press articles is included on the IPBES website (<a href="http://www.ipbes.net/article/ipbes-pollinationreport-media-coverage">www.ipbes.net/article/ipbes-pollinationreport-media-coverage</a>).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Other activities in addition to the communication strategy</strong> can be undertaken to encourage the use of the key findings of the assessment. These include:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Working with key partners on the use of findings, such as the parties and observers under relevant multilateral agreements;</p></li>
<li><p>Making knowledge and data gaps identified within the assessments available to the scientific community and research funding agencies (through the use of the knowledge catalysis function of IPBES) in order to generate further research, monitoring and modelling;</p></li>
<li><p>Working with countries, through capacity building activities, to implement mechanisms which will help to leverage further impacts of IPBES products, such as through national platforms and national assessments;</p></li>
<li><p>Capturing information on policy support tools in IPBES assessments and including it in the IPBES Catalogue to allow users to search and access the tools; and</p></li>
<li><p>Preparing a number of scientific publications on various aspects of the reports, undertaken by experts in the published assessments, which will be listed on the IPBES website.</p></li>
