The MEP will then produce a report for consideration by the Plenary, also depicting how the assessments will be integrated into the IPBES work programme.\n2.1.2 Consideration by the MEP and Bureau\n2.1.3 Consideration by the Plenary\nThe Plenary has two options to consider: approve the scoping report and initiate the assessment (based on an initial scoping by the MEP) or request a detailed scoping. Initiation of the assessment can go ahead without the detailed scoping study and proceed to the second stage of the assessment process without the Plenary needing to consider the outcome of a more detailed scoping exercise (see option B, Figure 2.2). In a majority of cases, the Plenary will request a detailed scoping before agreeing to undertake an assessment (See option A, Figure 2.2). The Plenary may delay the start of the second stage or initiate the assessment immediately based on the Scoping Report.\nIf the Plenary decides to proceed with detailed scoping of an assessment then a call for nomination of experts to assist in the scoping process is made (see Figure 2.2). A detailed scoping document, overseen by the MEP and Bureau, is developed by a group of experts. Typically, a meeting is convened where the scoping document is developed. An electronic consultation can also take place with experts self-selecting themselves to participate.\nA detailed scoping document will usually consist of the following information:\nMembers and other stakeholders of IPBES can then be invited to review and comment on the draft detailed scoping report. Based on the results of the detailed scoping exercise and comments received from members of the Platform and other stakeholders, the MEP, in consultation with the Bureau, then decides whether to proceed with the submission of the scoping report to the Plenary.\nOnce finalized, the draft detailed scoping document is presented to the Plenary, who examines it paragraph by paragraph. The Plenary can then decide between the following options:"

    "text": "What is an IPBES assessment?\nIPBES assessments synthesize and critically evaluate peer-reviewed scientific literature, grey literature and other available knowledge, such as indigenous and local knowledge. The assessments include a review and synthesis, as well as an analysis and an expert judgement of available knowledge. Experts are guided in this work by a conceptual framework outlining the interaction between people and nature and by guidance on the conceptualization of values of biodiversity and nature's contributions to people. An assessment does not involve the undertaking of new primary research but may include re‑analysis of data and models to address specific questions. Findings should be policy relevant but not policy-prescriptive. They could feed into and be guided by the work on policy support tools and methodologies, including its catalogue.[^5]\nIPBES assessments need to be credible, legitimate and relevant. They typically:\n\nInvolve governments and other stakeholders in the initiation, scoping, review and adoption of the assessment reports (this involvement promotes credibility, legitimacy and relevance at policy level);\nOperate through an open and transparent process, run by a group of experts that has a balance of disciplines, geography and gender, and who use agreed conceptual frameworks, methodologies and support tools, as well as are subject to independent peer review (this process promotes credibility, legitimacy and relevance at scientific level); and\nPresent findings and knowledge gaps that are policy relevant but not policy prescriptive, where the level of confidence and the range of available views are presented in an unbiased way (this approach promotes relevance at both scientific and policy level).\n\nIPBES assessments not only focus on what is known, but also on what is currently uncertain. Assessments play an important role in guiding policy through identifying areas of broad scientific agreement as well as areas of scientific uncertainty that may need further research.\nIPBES may undertake different types of assessments at sub-regional, regional and global levels. It also encourages and helps catalyse other assessments at lower scales, such as those with a local, national and a more limited sub-regional scope. IPBES is currently engaged in, has undertaken or has planned to undertake the following:\n\nGlobal assessments to assess biodiversity and ecosystem services and their interlinkages at the global scales. The global assessments will draw upon the work undertaken by the regional assessments.\nRegional assessments to assess biodiversity and ecosystem services and their interlinkages at the regional and, as necessary, sub-regional levels (e.g., Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia). Regional assessments will provide the building blocks for the global assessments.\nThematic assessments to assess a particular theme at an appropriate scale or a new topic (e.g., assessments of pollinators, pollination and food production, land degradation and restoration, invasive alien species and their control, and sustainable use).\nMethodological assessments to assess the availability and use of methods in relation with a specific topic (e.g., values, scenarios and models) so that these methods can then be used in IPBES assessments and other activities."

    "text": "2.2 Stage 2: Expert evaluation of the state of knowledge\n2.2.1 Nomination of experts by members and observers, and selection by the MEP\nThe Rules of Procedure for IPBES set out the nomination process for the different roles within an IPBES assessment (see IPBES/2/17 and decision IPBES-4/3)1,2 and are summarized in Table 1. The chair of IPBES, following the Plenary which requested the undertaking of an assessment, issues a call for nominations, explaining some of the requirements, particularly in terms of disciplines to cover all chapters of the assessment. Governments and observers are invited to nominate independent experts and fellows. From the nominations received, the MEP will select the report co-chairs, coordinating lead authors (CLA), lead authors (LA) and review editors (RE). The MEP will take the following into consideration when making these selections:\nTable 2.2 Who is who in an IPBES assessment: Roles and responsibilities\n2.2.2 Conflicts of interest\nIPBES has put in place conflict of interest policy and implementation procedures to ensure that attention is paid to issues of independence and bias in order for there to be public confidence in the product and processes of IPBES.6 IPBES defines conflicts of interest and bias as any circumstances that could lead a reasonable person to either question an individual’s objectivity or believe an unfair advantage has been created. The policy further sets out the difference between conflicts of interest and bias along with rules on how the policy should be applied when including the Committee of Conflicts of Interest. Within an IPBES assessment, all co-chairs, CLAs, LAs, REs, fellows and TSU members must sign a conflict of interest form.\n2.2.3 Assessment by experts\nA majority of IPBES assessments will be undertaken over three years (see Figure 2.3) and the timeline for each assessment is agreed by the Plenary as part of the acceptance of the scoping report for the assessment.\nThe evaluation is undertaken by a geographically and gender balanced multidisciplinary group of independent experts selected on their credentials from among a group of nominees. Their interaction with government representatives, observers and stakeholders takes place at the initiation, scoping, reviewing and approval stages of the assessment.\nTypically, an IPBES assessment process will consist of the development of different drafts of the technical report:\nThe development of these drafts, including the executive summaries of the chapters and the SPM, follows the chapter outline and addresses the guidance and questions set out in the approved scoping report. This process is usually supported by three author meetings and different review periods before being presented for discussion at the Plenary (see Figure 2.3). It involves an iterative and collective expert evaluation of the state of knowledge, which entails the preparation and review of the following successive draft chapters and summaries.\n2.2.4 Peer review process\nWithin an IPBES assessment there are two external review processes:\n1. Independent external peer review of the first order draft:\nExperts with relevant knowledge and credentials regarding the assessment, but not involved in the assessment, will be invited to critically review one or more chapters of the first order draft.\n2. Independent external peer review, review by governments and other stakeholders:\nGovernments, observers and any interested external expert can provide comments on the second order draft and the first order draft of the SPM.\nIPBES has three governing principles for their review process:\nThe Chair of the secretariat will issue a call for external comments and the draft chapters will be placed online in a password protected area. Experts, governments and stakeholders willing to make comments will register and commit to keep the documents confidential before receiving the texts for review. Review comments are submitted to the relevant assessment technical support units using a standard format (see Table 2.4). This allows for comments to be easily attributed to sections, pages and lines of the text and can be dealt with in an efficient manner.\n2.2.5 Developing executive summaries for chapters of an assessment report\nAn executive summary is, in principle, located at the start of each chapter to outline its key findings.\nThese summaries are crucial to communicate the outcomes of the assessment to its primary audience: members of IPBES, governments, observers and all other stakeholders. The executive summaries also provide:\n2.2.6 Using confidence terms\n2.2.6.1 Why does our communication of confidence matter in IPBES assessments?\n2.2.6.2 How to do I select confidence terms?\n2.2.6.3 Qualitative assessment of confidence\nFigure 2.4. The four-box model for the qualitative communication of confidence. Confidence increases towards the top-right corner as suggested by the increasing strength of shading.\n\nNote: ‘well-established’ can be further subdivided into ‘very well established’ and ‘virtually certain’.\nSource: IPBES, 2016.\n2.2.6.4 Quantitative assessment of confidence\nFigure 2.5. Likelihood scale for the quantitative communication of the probability of an outcome occurring\n\nNote: Extreme levels of probability are nested within the broader levels of “likely” and “unlikely”.\nSource: modified from Mastrandrea et al. 2010.\n2.2.6.5 How to present confidence terms:presenting confidence using the four-box model\n2.2.6.6 Presenting confidence using the likelihood scale\n2.2.6.7 Traceability\n2.2.6.8 Summary of the steps for applying confidence terms\n7. Optional: Consider using formal frameworks for assessing expert judgements for each author team.\n2.2.7.2 Steps to developing an SPM\nThe SPM for the IPBES assessments are approved line by line within the Plenary, therefore it is important to develop a succinct summary based upon the analysis of the assessment. Use confidence terminology to ensure that no ambiguity appears with regards to the messages and analyses in the SPM. Each finding should also contain a footnote with a reference back to the number of the section or sections of the main report that the finding is drawn from.\nBox 2.5 Example (extract) of how key findings (below the dashed line) are integrated into a key message (above the dashed line)\nSource: The IPBES Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production Assessment- key message 12; findings from page XXXV of the SPM."
