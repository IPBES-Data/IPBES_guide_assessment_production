2.1 Stage 1: Requests and scope

> An assessment begins upon receiving a request from a government (or
> when receiving inputs and suggestions from a stakeholder), which is
> then considered by the Plenary. The procedure for receiving and
> prioritizing requests represents the first stage in defining a new
> work programme. It has taken place once so far, in order to define the
> first work programme of IPBES, for 2014-2018. A new call for requests
> will take place towards the end of each work programme. The first set
> of requests led the Plenary to carry out a set of thematic,
> methodological and regional assessments, as well as a global
> assessment.
>
> *Note: The mechanism described in the following section was used for
> the production of the first work programme. The Plenary may decide,
> when building the second IPBES work programme, to make a number of
> adjustments based on lessons learnt. This means that some of the steps
> described below might be modified as lessons are learnt.*

2.1.1 Requests by members and observers

> The first stage in the IPBES assessment process is for requests,
> inputs and suggestions to be submitted to the IPBES Secretariat no
> later than six months before an IPBES Plenary.[^1] Submissions should
> include information on:

- The relevance of the objective, function and work programme of the
  Platform;

- The urgency of action in light of imminent risks caused by issues
  addressed in the action;

- The relevance of the requested action in addressing specific policies
  or processes;

- The geographic scope of the requested action, as well as issues to be
  covered by such action;

- The anticipated level of complexity of the issues to be addressed by
  the requested action;

- Any previous work and existing initiatives of a similar nature and
  evidence of remaining gaps, such as the absence or limited
  availability of information and tools to address the issues, and
  reasons why the Platform is best suited to take action;

- The availability of scientific literature and expertise for the
  Platform to undertake the requested action;

- The scale of the potential impacts and the potential beneficiaries of
  the requested action;

- The requirements for financial and human resources, and the potential
  duration of the requested action; and

- An identification of priorities within the multiple submitted
  requests.

The list of requests, inputs and suggestions are compiled by the IPBES
secretariat for prioritization by the Multidisciplinary Expert Panel
(MEP) in consultation with the Bureau. The MEP will then produce a
report for consideration by the Plenary, also depicting how the
assessments will be integrated into the IPBES work programme.

2.1.2 Consideration by the MEP and Bureau

> As part of the preliminary evaluation and prioritization process, the
> MEP and Bureau will undertake an initial scoping of an assessment,
> including examining feasibility and estimated costs. This initial
> scoping study may also contain pre-scoping material, usually provided
> by the body making the original request for the assessment. Using this
> information, the MEP, in conjunction with the Bureau, will prepare a
> report containing a prioritized list of requested assessments to be
> submitted to the Plenary. The report will contain an analysis of the
> scientific and policy relevance of the requests, including the
> implication of the requests for the Platform's work programme and
> resources requirements.

2.1.3 Consideration by the Plenary

The Plenary has two options to consider: approve the scoping report and
initiate the assessment (based on an initial scoping by the MEP) or
request a detailed scoping. Initiation of the assessment can go ahead
without the detailed scoping study and proceed to the second stage of
the assessment process without the Plenary needing to consider the
outcome of a more detailed scoping exercise (see option B, Figure 2.2).
In a majority of cases, the Plenary will request a detailed scoping
before agreeing to undertake an assessment (See option A, Figure 2.2).
The Plenary may delay the start of the second stage or initiate the
assessment immediately based on the Scoping Report.

> 2.1.4 Scoping by the MEP, Bureau and experts

If the Plenary decides to proceed with detailed scoping of an assessment
then a call for nomination of experts to assist in the scoping process
is made (see Figure 2.2). A detailed scoping document, overseen by the
MEP and Bureau, is developed by a group of experts. Typically, a meeting
is convened where the scoping document is developed. An electronic
consultation can also take place with experts self-selecting themselves
to participate.

A detailed scoping document will usually consist of the following
information:

1.  The scope (including policy relevant questions);

2.  Geographic boundaries of the assessment (if relevant);

3.  The rationale (including the potential impact of the assessment);

4.  The assessment's utility (including who the end users of the
    assessments are);

5.  Assumptions;

6.  Methodological approaches;

7.  Chapter outlines (including a short paragraph on the potential
    content for each chapter);

8.  Key datasets (this is not an exhaustive list but rather key datasets
    which should be mobilized);

9.  Strategic partnerships and initiatives (this is not an exhaustive
    list but could either highlight the types of partnerships which will
    be required to deliver the assessment or include a short list key
    partners);

10. The operational structure (including if a technical support unit
    will be required);

11. The process and timetable;

12. A cost estimate;

13. Communication and outreach; and

14. Capacity-building (highlights what capacity may be needed to
    undertake the assessment).

Members and other stakeholders of IPBES can then be invited to review
and comment on the draft detailed scoping report. Based on the results
of the detailed scoping exercise and comments received from members of
the Platform and other stakeholders, the MEP, in consultation with the
Bureau, then decides whether to proceed with the submission of the
scoping report to the Plenary.

> 2.1.5 Consideration by the Plenary

Once finalized, the draft detailed scoping document is presented to the
Plenary, who examines it paragraph by paragraph. The Plenary can then
decide between the following options:

1.  Approve the assessment and request its undertaking (including
    related budget and timeline).

2.  Approve the assessment but delay its undertaking.

3.  Not approve and request further scoping.

4.  Not approve.
