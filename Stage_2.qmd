2.2 Stage 2: Expert evaluation of the state of knowledge

2.2.1 Nomination of experts by members and observers, and selection by
the MEP

The Rules of Procedure for IPBES set out the nomination process for the
different roles within an IPBES assessment (see IPBES/2/17 and decision
IPBES-4/3)[^1]^,^[^2] and are summarized in Table 1. The chair of IPBES,
following the Plenary which requested the undertaking of an assessment,
issues a call for nominations, explaining some of the requirements,
particularly in terms of disciplines to cover all chapters of the
assessment. Governments and observers are invited to nominate
independent experts and fellows. From the nominations received, the MEP
will select the report co-chairs, coordinating lead authors (CLA), lead
authors (LA) and review editors (RE). The MEP will take the following
into consideration when making these selections:

- 80% of the selected experts should be nominated by governments and 20%
  by an organization.

- The selection should reflect a range of scientific, technical and
  socio-economic views and expertise (e.g., natural and social sciences,
  scholars from the humanities, knowledge holders and experts in
  indigenous and local knowledge (ILK)).

- The selection should have a good geographic representation, with
  appropriate representation of experts from developing and developed
  countries and countries with economies in transition.

- The diversity of knowledge systems (including indigenous and local
  knowledge) should be represented.

- The selection should aim at reaching gender balance.

> While every effort should be made to engage experts on the author
> teams from the relevant regions, with regards to chapters or
> assessments that deal with those specific regions, experts from other
> regions can be engaged if they can provide an important contribution
> to the assessment. If gaps in geographical, gender and expertise
> balances are identified, the co-chairs of the assessments, together
> with their respective CLAs, can identify potential additional experts
> to fill in these gaps. These experts will then be retroactively
> nominated following the approved procedure for **filling gaps** among
> groups of experts approved by the fourth session of the Plenary (see
> IPBES/4/19 and decision IPBES-4/3).[^3]^,^[^4]
>
> MEP or Bureau members that would like to participate as an expert in
> an assessment can be nominated for such a role, but they will have to
> resign from their duties as an MEP or Bureau member when accepting the
> new role.
>
> The co-chairs, CLAs, LAs, REs, Fellows and Contributing Authors (CAs)
> have different responsibilities within a particular IPBES assessment.
> Each role in an Assessments not only has a specific nomination process
> but also has different responsibilities within a particular IPBES
> assessment (see Table 2.1). These roles are further described in Table
> 2.2.

| **Box 2.1 Writing suggestions for assessment reports**                |
+=======================================================================+
| The suggestions below are based on comments received during the       |
| Millennium Ecosystem Assessment peer review process:                  |
|                                                                       |
| - Discuss the problems and actions first. Any necessary background    |
|   can come later in an appendix or in references to other sources.    |
|                                                                       |
| - Focus on definable measures/actions and avoid the passive voice.    |
|   For example, policy professionals are likely to ignore statements   |
|   like "there are reasons to believe some trends can be slowed or     |
|   even reversed". If there are some opportunities for reversal, state |
|   precisely what we believe they are to the best of our knowledge.    |
|                                                                       |
| - Statements like "\...might have enormous ramifications for health   |
|   and productivity\..." may seem to be strong because of the word     |
|   "enormous", but they are actually politically impotent because of   |
|   the word "might." If data are used in the assessment, what do they  |
|   say about what "is" happening? What can we recommend, based on the  |
|   best available knowledge, about what actions would be effective?    |
|                                                                       |
| - A statements like "there is a long history of concern over the      |
|   environmental effects of fishing in coastal habitats, but the vast  |
|   scope of ecological degradation is only recently becoming apparent  |
|   (citation)" is a case where something strong could be said but it   |
|   is weakened by putting emphasis on the late arrival of this         |
|   information and knowledge "becoming apparent". It does not matter   |
|   so much when the degradation was discovered, what matters is that   |
|   it was. Cite the source and say "fishing practices are causing      |
|   wide‑spread destruction".                                           |
|                                                                       |
| - Do not use value-laden, flowery or colloquial language (e.g.,       |
|   "sleeping dragon", "elephant in the room", etc.).                   |
|                                                                       |
| - Statements like "we do not yet have clear guidelines for achieving  |
|   responsible, effective management of natural resources" could       |
|   result in a legitimate policy response of "OK, so we'll wait until  |
|   we do". Instead, the statement could be changed to recommend what   |
|   needs to be done, such as, "if clear guidelines were developed,     |
|   then\...".                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| - Diverse formats and modes of communication, for example             |
|   participatory maps, artwork and visual imagery, will be important   |
|   for working with indigenous and local knowledge.                    |
|                                                                       |

2.2.2 Conflicts of interest

IPBES has put in place conflict of interest policy and implementation
procedures to ensure that attention is paid to issues of independence
and bias in order for there to be public confidence in the product and
processes of IPBES.[^6] IPBES defines conflicts of interest and bias as
any circumstances that could lead a reasonable person to either question
an individual's objectivity or believe an unfair advantage has been
created. The policy further sets out the difference between conflicts of
interest and bias along with rules on how the policy should be applied
when including the Committee of Conflicts of Interest. Within an IPBES
assessment, all co-chairs, CLAs, LAs, REs, fellows and TSU members must
sign a conflict of interest form.

2.2.3 Assessment by experts

A majority of IPBES assessments will be undertaken over three years (see
Figure 2.3) and the timeline for each assessment is agreed by the
Plenary as part of the acceptance of the scoping report for the
assessment.

The evaluation is undertaken by a geographically and gender balanced
multidisciplinary group of independent experts selected on their
credentials from among a group of nominees. Their interaction with
government representatives, observers and stakeholders takes place at
the initiation, scoping, reviewing and approval stages of the
assessment.

Typically, an IPBES assessment process will consist of the development
of different drafts of the technical report:

- Annotated outline

- Zero order draft

- First order draft (1^st^ order draft)

- Second order draft (2^nd^ order draft)

- Final draft

The development of these drafts, including the executive summaries of
the chapters and the SPM, follows the chapter outline and addresses the
guidance and questions set out in the approved scoping report. This
process is usually supported by three author meetings and different
review periods before being presented for discussion at the Plenary (see
Figure 2.3). It involves an iterative and collective expert evaluation
of the state of knowledge, which entails the preparation and review of
the following successive draft chapters and summaries.

|             |              | should include an executive summary.   |
|             |              | Authors should have thought about      |
|             |              | graphics and either have identified    |
|             |              | existing graphics for inclusion or     |

: **Table 2.3** What should happen at each step of the Stage 2
preparation and who should be involved?

2.2.4 Peer review process

Within an IPBES assessment there are two external review processes:

1\. Independent external peer review of the first order draft:\
Experts with relevant knowledge and credentials regarding the
assessment, but not involved in the assessment, will be invited to
critically review one or more chapters of the first order draft.

2\. Independent external peer review, review by governments and other
stakeholders:\
Governments, observers and any interested external expert can provide
comments on the second order draft and the first order draft of the SPM.

IPBES has three governing principles for their review process:

1.  ***Provide expert advice*:**\
    Seek the best scientific and technical guidance.

2.  ***Ensure comprehensive independent representation:***\
    Invite responses from all countries and stakeholder groups.

3.  ***Follow a transparent and open process*:**\
    Make all comments and author responses received available online.

The Chair of the secretariat will issue a call for external comments and
the draft chapters will be placed online in a password protected area.
Experts, governments and stakeholders willing to make comments will
register and commit to keep the documents confidential before receiving
the texts for review. Review comments are submitted to the relevant
assessment technical support units using a standard format (see Table
2.4). This allows for comments to be easily attributed to sections,
pages and lines of the text and can be dealt with in an efficient
manner.

2.2.5 Developing executive summaries for chapters of an assessment
report

An executive summary is, in principle, located at the start of each
chapter to outline its key findings.

These summaries are crucial to communicate the outcomes of the
assessment to its primary audience: members of IPBES, governments,
observers and all other stakeholders. The executive summaries also
provide:

- confidence statements in support of each key finding (see section
  2.3.6);

- links to sections in the full chapters that contain relevant
  supporting evidence and literature (traceability of findings);

- input to the SPM; and

- an explicit link between the SPM key findings and the sections within
  the full technical report providing supporting evidence (a traceable,
  evidence 'paper trail').

> The SPMs need to be written clearly, concisely and using simple
> language. This will facilitate effective communication of the key
> findings. Executive summaries are technical in nature and are based on
> the analysis set out in the chapter. They are not the same as an
> abstract of a scientific paper, but they should be a synthesis
> analysis and collective expert judgement of the chapter's findings.
> One of the key differences between the executive summaries and the SPM
> is moving from setting out the technical facts to blending and
> synthesizing the findings from different chapters into policy-relevant
> messages. A key finding in the SPM should be readily traceable back to
> a main finding(s) in an executive summary that in turn should be
> readily traceable back to a section(s) of the chapter text, which
> should be traceable, where appropriate, to the primary literature
> through references. References to the relevant executive summary
> statement within the SPM are included in curly brackets (e.g., {1.2}),
> see Box 2.2 for examples.

| **Many wild bees and butterflies have been declining in abundance,    |
| occurrence and diversity at local and regional scales in North-West   |
| Europe and North America (established but incomplete); data for other |
| regions and pollinator groups are currently insufficient to draw      |
| general conclusions, although local declines have been reported.** At |
| a regional level, declines in the diversity of bees and               |
| pollinator-dependent wild plants have been recorded in highly         |
| industrialized regions of the world, particularly Western Europe and  |
| Eastern North America, over the last century (well established).      |
| \[...\] In agricultural systems, the local abundance and diversity of |
| wild bees have been found to decline strongly with distance from      |
| field margins and remnants of natural and semi natural habitat at     |
| scales of a few hundred metres (well established) {3.2.2, 3.2.3}.     |

| **The number of managed western honey bee hives is increasing at the  |
| global scale, although seasonal colony loss is high in some European  |
| countries and in North America (well established) (figure SPM.5).     |
| Colony losses may not always result in irreversible declines, as      |
| losses can be mitigated by beekeepers splitting colonies to recover   |
| or even exceed seasonal losses**. The seasonal loss of western honey  |
| bees in Europe and North America varies strongly by country, state    |
| and province and by year, but in recent decades (at least since the   |
| widespread introduction of Varroa) has often been higher than the     |
| 10-15 per cent that was previously regarded as normal (established    |
| but incomplete). Data for other regions of the world is largely       |
| lacking {2.4.2.3, 2.4.2.4, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5}.               |

| **Commercial management, mass breeding, transport and trade in        |
| pollinators outside their original ranges have resulted in new        |
| invasions, transmission of pathogens and parasites and regional       |
| extinctions of native pollinator species (well established).**        |
| Recently developed commercial rearing of bumble bee species for       |
| greenhouse and field crop pollination, and their introduction         |
|                                                                       |
| to continents outside of their original ranges, have resulted in      |
| biological invasions, pathogen transmission to native species and the |
| decline of congeneric (sub-)species (established but incomplete). A   |
| well-documented case is the severe decline in and extirpation from    |
| many areas of its original                                            |
|                                                                       |

| introduction and spread of the European B. terrestris in southern     |
| South America (well established) {3.2.3, 3.3.3,3.4.32, 3.4.3}. The    |
| presence of managed honey bees and their escaped descendants (for     |
| example African honey bees in the Americas) have changed visitation   |
| patterns to the native plants in those regions (unresolved) {3.2.3,   |
| 3.3.2, 3.4.2, 3.4.3}. Better regulation of the movement of all        |
| species of managed pollinators around the world, and within           |
| countries, can limit the spread of parasites and pathogens to managed |
| and wild pollinators alike and reduce the likelihood that pollinators |
| will be introduced outside their native ranges and cause negative     |
| impacts (established but incomplete) {6.4.4.2}.                       |

2.2.6 Using confidence terms

> When we talk about confidence in assessments in relation to knowledge,
> we are referring to how assured experts are about the findings (data
> and information) presented within their chapters. Low confidence
> describes a situation where we have incomplete knowledge and therefore
> cannot fully explain an outcome or reliably predict a future outcome,
> whereas high confidence conveys that we have extensive knowledge and
> are able to explain an outcome or predict a future outcome with much
> greater certainty.

2.2.6.1 Why does our communication of confidence matter in IPBES
assessments?

> Knowledge and scientific data about the natural world and the
> influence of human activities are complex. There is a need to
> communicate what the assessment author teams have high confidence in
> as well as what requires further investigation to allow
> decision-makers to make informed decisions. Furthermore, by following
> a common approach when applying confidence terminology within an
> assessment, authors are able to increase consistency and transparency.
>
> IPBES assessments will use specific phrases known as "confidence
> terms" in order to ensure consistency in the communication of
> confidence by author teams. What confidence term is used will depend
> on the author team's expert judgement on the quantity and quality of
> the supporting evidence and the level of scientific agreement. IPBES
> assessments use a four-box model of confidence (see Figure 2.5) based
> on evidence and agreements that give four main confidence terms: "well
> established" (much evidence and high agreement), "unresolved" (much
> evidence but low agreement), "established but incomplete" (limited
> evidence but good agreement) and "inconclusive" (limited or no
> evidence and little agreement).
>
> The following guidance will discuss where confidence terms must be
> applied in the IPBES assessment reports, how to select the appropriate
> term to communicate the author team's confidence and how to present
> the confidence terms in the text.
>
> Confidence terms should always be used in two key parts of an
> assessment:

1.  They should be assigned to the key findings in the **executive
    summaries** of the technical chapters in an assessment report (see
    Box 2.2), and

2.  For both key messages and key findings of the SPMs (see Box 2.3).

2.2.6.2 How to do I select confidence terms?

> Once the author team has identified the chapter's key messages and
> findings, in order to present these in the **executive summary** or
> **SPM**, it is mandatory to evaluate the quality and quantity of
> associated evidence and scientific agreement. Author teams will always
> be required to make qualitative **assessments** of confidence based on
> expert estimates of agreements and evidence.
>
> Depending on the nature of the evidence supporting the key message or
> finding, **quantitative assessments** of confidence may also be
> possible. Quantitative assessments of confidence are estimates of the
> likelihood (probability) that a well-defined outcome will occur in the
> future. Probabilistic estimates are based on statistical analyses of
> observations or model results, or both, combined with expert judgment.
> However, it may be that quantitative assessments of confidence are not
> possible in all assessments due to the nature of the evidence
> available.
>
> It is not mandatory to apply confidence terms throughout the main text
> of the assessment report. However, in some parts of the main text, in
> areas where there are a range of views that need to be described,
> confidence terms may be applied where considered appropriate by the
> author team. In order to avoid confusing readers, in no case should
> the terms be used colloquially or casually. Use these terms if you
> have followed the recommended steps for assessing confidence.

2.2.6.3 Qualitative assessment of confidence

> This section discusses the process and language that all author teams
> must apply to evaluate and communicate confidence qualitatively. The
> following factors should be considered to evaluate the validity of the
> message or finding: the type, quantity, quality and consistency of
> evidence (the existing peer‑reviewed literature and grey literature,
> etc.), as well as the level of agreement (the level of concurrence in
> the data, literature and amongst experts, not just across the author
> team). The author team's expert judgement on the level of evidence and
> agreement should then be used to apply a confidence term as described
> in Figure 2.4:

- ***Inconclusive*** -- existing as or based on a suggestion or
  speculation; no or limited evidence.

- ***Unresolved*** -- multiple independent studies exist but conclusions
  do not agree.

- ***Established but incomplete*** -- general agreement although only a
  limited number of studies exist but with no comprehensive synthesis,
  or the studies that do exist imprecisely address the question.

- ***Well established*** -- comprehensive meta-analysis or other
  syntheses/multiple independent studies that agree.

*Source: IPBES, 2016.*

> The ***well-established*** box in Figure 2.4 may be further subdivided
> in order to give author teams the flexibility to emphasize key
> messages and findings that the author team have very high confidence
> in:

- ***Very well established*** -- very comprehensive evidence base and
  very low amount of disagreement.

- ***Virtually certain*** -- very robust data covering multiple temporal
  and spatial scales and almost no disagreement.

> The qualitative confidence terms discussed in this section should not
> be interpreted probabilistically and are distinct from "statistical
> significance".
>
> ***Virtually certain*** will not be used by the author teams
> frequently in the assessment report. The confidence terms used to
> communicate high confidence are intended to provide authors with the
> flexibility to emphasize issues that may be considered as fact by the
> scientific community but not by the non-scientific community
> (decision-makers, media and the general public). In most cases it may
> be appropriate to describe these findings using overwhelming evidence
> and agreements as statements of fact without using confidence
> qualifiers.
>
> Similarly, ***inconclusive*** may also be used infrequently, but is
> intended to provide authors with the flexibility to emphasize issues
> that are not established in science but that are important to
> policymakers or might have been highlighted by a different audience.
>
> The degree of confidence in findings that are conditional on other
> findings should be evaluated and reported separately.
>
> When evaluating the levels of evidence and agreements for a statement,
> it is important to standardize the use of the terms within and across
> the author teams and, when possible, across the assessment in order to
> ensure their consistent use. The use of the discussed confidence terms
> can be standardized by taking key messages and findings in the
> **executive summaries** and discussing, as an author team, what terms
> should be applied and the reasons why. When appropriate, consider
> using formal elicitation methods to organize and quantify the
> selection of confidence terms.
>
> Be aware of the tendency for a group to converge on an expressed view
> and become overconfident in it. One method to avoid this would be to
> ask each member of the author team to write down his or her individual
> assessment of the level of confidence before entering into a group
> discussion. If this is not done before a group discussion, important
> views and ranges of confidence may be inadequately discussed and
> assessed. It is important to recognize when individual views are
> adjusting as a result of group interactions and allow adequate time
> for such changes in viewpoint to be reviewed (Mastrandrea et al.
> 2010). Whichever approach is taken, traceable accounts should be
> produced and recorded to demonstrate how confidence was evaluated.
>
> It is important to carefully consider how the sentences in the key
> messages and findings are structured because it will influence the
> clarity with which we communicate our understanding of the level of
> confidence. For example, sometimes the key finding combines an element
> that is ***well-established*** with one that is ***established but
> incomplete***. In this case it can be helpful to arrange the phrasing
> so that the ***well-established*** element comes first and the
> ***established but incomplete*** element comes second, or as a
> separate sentence. Avoid the use of ***unresolved*** and
> ***established but incomplete*** where possible by writing or
> rewording key messages and findings in terms of what is known rather
> than unknown. Author teams should focus on presenting what is
> ***well-established*** as far as possible in order to make it clear to
> decision-makers what is known. Assigning confidence terms to our key
> findings will therefore often require that we re-write sentences,
> rather than simply adding the terms to existing text.

2.2.6.4 Quantitative assessment of confidence

> This section discusses the process and language that author teams may
> wish to apply in order to evaluate and communicate the confidence that
> an outcome will occur quantitatively. Likelihood expresses a
> probabilistic estimate of the occurrence of a single event or of an
> outcome within a given range. Probabilistic estimates are based on
> statistical analyses of observations or model results, or both,
> combined with expert judgment.
>
> When sufficient probabilistic information is available, consider
> ranges of outcomes and their associated probabilities with attention
> to outcomes of potential high consequence. The author team's expert
> judgement on the magnitude of the probability should then be used to
> apply a likelihood term (see Figure 2.5).

![cid:FE03DB87-0578-4829-856C-24401E083F19@home](images/Stage_2/media/image4.jpeg){width="6.9534722222222225in"

**Figure 2.5. Likelihood scale for the quantitative communication of the
probability of an outcome occurring**\
\
Note: Extreme levels of probability are nested within the broader levels
of "likely" and "unlikely".\
*Source: modified from Mastrandrea et al. 2010.*

> Categories in Figure 2.5 can be considered to have nested boundaries.
> For example, describing an outcome as ***likely*** or ***very
> likely*** conveys in both cases that the probability of this outcome
> could fall within the range of 95% to 100% probability. However, in
> the case of ***likely***, the larger range (66-100%) indicates a
> higher degree of confidence than ***very likely*** (90-100%). In
> making their expert judgement, author teams should start at ***about
> as likely as not*** and consider whether there is sufficient
> quantitative information available to assign either a ***likely*** or
> ***unlikely*** probability range. Only after thinking about this
> initial range should the author teams consider whether there is
> sufficient evidence to move to more extreme levels of probability.
>
> Author teams should note that using a likelihood term for a specific
> outcome implies that alternative outcomes have the inverse likelihood,
> e.g., if an outcome is ***likely*** (a range of 66-100%) then that
> would imply that other outcomes are ***unlikely*** (0-33%
> probability).
>
> If the author team consider that sufficiently robust information is
> available with which to make a 'best estimate' of the probability of
> the occurrence of an event, then it is preferable to specify the full
> probability range (e.g., 90-95%) in the text without using the terms
> in Figure 2.5. Also, ***about as likely as not*** should not be used
> to communicate a lack of knowledge, only as an estimate of probability
> based on the available information.
>
> Author teams should be aware of the way in which key messages and
> findings are phrased. The way in which a statement is framed will have
> an effect on how it is interpreted, e.g., a 10% chance of dying is
> interpreted more negatively than a 90% chance of surviving. Consider
> reciprocal statements to avoid value-laden interpretations, e.g.,
> report chances of both dying and surviving (Mastrandrea et al. 2010).
>
> Finally, author teams should try not to avoid controversial events,
> such as impacts or events with high consequence but extremely low
> probability, in their effort to achieve consensus within an author

2.2.6.5 How to present confidence terms:presenting confidence using the
four-box model

> Confidence terms are communicated as part of the key findings of an
> assessment. The key findings are set out in the **executive
> summaries** for each of the assessment's chapters in the full
> technical report. The key findings are the facts and information drawn
> directly from the chapter. It is recommended that key findings should
> be set out as follows.
>
> **The first sentence of the finding should be bolded** and contain a
> confidence term from the four-box model in italics and brackets at the
> end of the sentence. This first sentence is followed by two to four
> sentences which then supports the information contained in this first
> sentence. Subsequent sentences may contain confidence terms within
> brackets where appropriate. It is not necessary to include confidence
> terms with each sentence if the whole paragraph falls under the same
> confidence term.
>
> The words that make up the four-box model and likelihood scale should
> [not]{.underline} be used in the text of the assessment except when
> formally assigning confidence. If, for example, there was a sentence
> that used the word "likely" but not with the intended meaning from the
> likelihood scale, then the word should be replaced with another (e.g.,
> probably).

2.2.6.6 Presenting confidence using the likelihood scale

> In some instances, author teams may wish to complement the use of the
> ***well-established*** confidence term with a term from the likelihood
> scale. If terms from the likelihood scale are used then they should be
> incorporated into the text and italicized prior to the impact or
> outcome of the probability of which they are describing.

2.2.6.7 Traceability

> The author team's expert judgment of their confidence in the key
> messages and findings should be explained by providing a clear
> traceable account. A traceable account is a description in the chapter
> of the evaluation of the type, quantity, quality and consistency of
> the evidence and level of agreement that forms the basis for the given
> key message or finding (Mastrandrea et al. 2010). Where possible, the
> description should identify and discuss the sources of confidence. In
> order to ensure consistency in how the author teams classify sources
> of confidence within and across IPBES assessments, author teams should
> use the typology shown in Table 2.5.
>
> A main finding in the **summary for policymakers** should be readily
> traceable back to an **executive summary** main finding(s) that in
> turn should be readily traceable back to a section(s) of the chapter
> text, which should be traceable, where appropriate, to the primary
> literature through references.
>
> References to the relevant **executive summary** statement in the SPM
> should be included in curly brackets (e.g., {1.2}), see Box 2.2.

2.2.6.8 Summary of the steps for applying confidence terms

> The steps recommended for assessing and communicating confidence for
> executive summaries and SPMs is as follows:

1.  Identify the chapter's key messages and findings.

2.  Evaluate the supporting evidence and the level of scientific
    agreement.

3.  Establish whether the evidence is probabilistic or not (e.g., from
    model predictions).

4.  Where the evidence is qualitative instead or probabilistic, select a
    confidence term from the **four-box model** (see Figure 2.4) to
    communicate the author team's confidence in the key message or
    finding.

    a.  Assess the quantity and quality of evidence and the level of
        agreement in the scientific community.

    b.  Establish how confident the author team is and select the
        appropriate term.

5.  Where quantitative estimates of the probability of an outcome or
    impact occurring are available (e.g., from model predictions),
    select a likelihood term from the **likelihood scale** (see Table
    2.5) to communicate the author teams' expert judgement of the range
    of the probability of occurrence.

6.  Ensure that there is always a 'traceable account' in the main text
    describing how the author team adopted the specific level of
    confidence, including the important lines of evidence used, the
    standard of evidence applied and the approaches to combine/reconcile
    multiple lines of evidence. Where specific sources of confidence are
    prominent for a key finding, the terms used in the left-hand column
    of Table 2.5 should be included in the traceable account.

7\. Optional: Consider using formal frameworks for assessing expert
judgements for each author team.

|   6\. **The vast majority of pollinator species are wild, including   |
|   more than 20,000 species of bees, some species of flies,            |
|   butterflies, moths, wasps, beetles, thrips, birds, bats and other   |
|   vertebrates. A few species of bees are widely managed, including    |
|   the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), the eastern honey bee       |
|   (Apis cerana), some bumble bees, some stingless bees and a few      |
|   solitary bees**. Beekeeping provides an important source of income  |
|   for many rural livelihoods. The western honey bee is the most       |
|   widespread managed pollinator in the world, and globally there are  |
|   about 81 million hives producing an estimated 1.6 million tonnes    |
|   of honey.                                                           |

|   11\. **The number of managed western honey bee hives has increased  |
|   globally over the last five decades, even though declines have      |
|   been recorded in some European countries and North America over     |
|   the same period**. Seasonal colony loss of western honey bees has   |
|   in recent years been high at least in some parts of the temperate   |
|   Northern Hemisphere and in South Africa. Beekeepers can under some  |
|   conditions, with associated economic costs, make up such losses     |
|   through the splitting of managed colonies.                          |

|   provision of pollination are threatened by direct drivers that      |
|   generate risks to societies and ecosystems**. Threats include       |

|   individual or combinations of direct drivers is limited by data     |
|   availability or complexity, yet a wealth of individual case         |
|   studies worldwide suggests that these direct drivers often affect   |
|   pollinators negatively.                                             |
|                                                                       |

|   carry traits for herbicide tolerance (HT) or insect resistance      |
|   (IR).** Reduced weed populations are likely to accompany most       |
|   herbicide-tolerant (HT) crops, diminishing food resources for       |
|   pollinators. The actual consequences for the abundance and          |
|   diversity of pollinators foraging in herbicide-tolerant (HT)-crop   |
|   fields is unknown. Insect-resistant (IR) crops can result in the    |
|   reduction of insecticide use, which varies regionally according to  |
|   the prevalence of pests, the emergence of secondary outbreaks of    |
|   non-target pests or primary pest resistance. If sustained, the      |
|   reduction in insecticide use could reduce pressure on nontarget     |
|   insects. How insect-resistant (IR) crop use and reduced pesticide   |
|   use affect pollinator abundance and diversity is unknown. Risk      |
|   assessments required for the approval of genetically‑modified       |
|   organism (GMO) crops in most countries do not adequately address    |
|   the direct sublethal effects of insect-resistant (IR) crops or the  |
|   indirect effects of herbicide-tolerant (HT) and insect-resistant    |
|   (IR) crops, partly because of a lack of data*.*                     |

> The key messages of the SPM aim to:

- tell a short, coherent and compelling story on the state of knowledge
  aimed at non‑technical decision-makers and the public;

- convey illustrative and striking perspectives, facts and numbers from
  the assessment;

- set the stage for the negotiation of the SPM at the IPBES Plenary; and

- serve as a key source for media and outreach material once approved by
  the Plenary.

> These messages are followed by a set of main findings categorized
> under a set of headings (approximately 10,000 words max). They tell a
> comprehensive story, based on the state of knowledge specific to the
> scoping document, and are aimed at non-technical decision-makers but
> with higher levels of technical yet non-jargon specificity compared to
> the top key messages (see Box 2.4).
>
> Each finding is formulated in one or two bolded sentences,
> substantiated and supported with statements amounting to one paragraph
> of text. The statements in the messages are assigned confidence levels
> and often start with the ones that have highest confidence. Findings
> can be traced back to the underlining chapter section(s) from which
> they are drawn.

> The responsibility for preparing the first and revised drafts of the

> The features of an SPM are that it:

- sets out policy relevant messages from the assessment while not being
  policy prescriptive, and

- builds on the executive summaries (key findings) from each chapter
  from the technical assessment report.

> The development of an SPM is an iterative process as explained in the
> following section . You will need to make sure that the information in
> each chapter's executive summary underpins the messages set out in the
> SPM and that the analyses in the assessment chapters support the

> Important points to recognize from the Pollination Assessment SPM:

- There are a total of 11 key findings that are short and indicated in
  bold.

- Each key finding comes with a confidence language statement (in
  parentheses).

- Further explanations for the key findings are provided via additional
  text about a paragraph in length each.

- The total word count is around 1,400.

- Each key finding includes a list of the chapter sections that contain
  the relevant literature/evidence supporting it.

- SPMs of methodological assessments may contain guidance points, which
  are lessons from best practices for building greater understanding and
  strengthening approaches to and making more effective use of
  methodological themes (see for example the Scenarios and Models
  Assessment SPM).[^7]

- In the context of IPBES, **policy support tools and methodologies**
  may be defined as approaches based on science and other knowledge
  systems that can inform, assist and enhance relevant decisions,
  policymaking and implementation at local, national, regional and
  global levels in order to protect nature, thereby promoting nature's
  contributions to people and a good quality of life (IPBES core
  glossary).[^8]

- Assessments may identify and assess the availability, effectiveness,
  practicability and replicability of current and emerging policy
  support tools and methodologies, as well as identify related gaps and
  needs[^9]

2.2.7.2 Steps to developing an SPM

> *Step 1: Developing executive summaries*
>
> The first step in developing an SPM is the development of an executive
> summary for each chapter. The executive summaries set out the key
> findings with the appropriate confidence terms for a particular
> chapter (see section 2.2.6.8 for further guidance on applying
> confidence terms). The content of the executive summary should be
> technical in nature and based on the analysis set out in the chapter.
>
> *Step 2: Identify the policy-relevant messages*
>
> One of the key differences between the executive summaries and the SPM
> is moving from the process of setting out technical facts to blending
> and synthesizing the findings from different chapters into
> policy-relevant messages. These messages aim to tell a short, coherent
> and compelling story on the state of knowledge (see Box 2.5).
>
> This stage is critical for fine-tuning the articulation of key
> findings and policy-relevant messages in the SPM, developing graphics,
> quality assurance of chapters, and ensuring consistency and
> traceability of confidence statements between the SPM and chapters.
> The drafts are process‑validated by the MEP and Bureau and are
> presented by the secretariat to the Plenary during Stage 3 -- approval
> and acceptance of the final assessment report.[^10]

The SPM for the IPBES assessments are approved line by line within the
Plenary, therefore it is important to develop a succinct summary based
upon the analysis of the assessment. Use confidence terminology to
ensure that no ambiguity appears with regards to the messages and
analyses in the SPM. Each finding should also contain a footnote with a
reference back to the number of the section or sections of the main
report that the finding is drawn from.
