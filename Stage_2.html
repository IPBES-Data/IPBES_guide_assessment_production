<p>The Rules of Procedure for IPBES set out the nomination process for the different roles within an IPBES assessment (see IPBES/2/17 and decision IPBES-4/3)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and are summarized in Table 1. The chair of IPBES, following the Plenary which requested the undertaking of an assessment, issues a call for nominations, explaining some of the requirements, particularly in terms of disciplines to cover all chapters of the assessment. Governments and observers are invited to nominate independent experts and fellows. From the nominations received, the MEP will select the report co-chairs, coordinating lead authors (CLA), lead authors (LA) and review editors (RE). The MEP will take the following into consideration when making these selections:</p>
<ul>
<li>80% of the selected experts should be nominated by governments and 20% by an organization.</li>
<li>The selection should reflect a range of scientific, technical and socio-economic views and expertise (e.g., natural and social sciences, scholars from the humanities, knowledge holders and experts in indigenous and local knowledge (ILK)).</li>
<li>The selection should have a good geographic representation, with appropriate representation of experts from developing and developed countries and countries with economies in transition.</li>
<li>The diversity of knowledge systems (including indigenous and local knowledge) should be represented.</li>
<li>The selection should aim at reaching gender balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>While every effort should be made to engage experts on the author teams from the relevant regions, with regards to chapters or assessments that deal with those specific regions, experts from other regions can be engaged if they can provide an important contribution to the assessment. If gaps in geographical, gender and expertise balances are identified, the co-chairs of the assessments, together with their respective CLAs, can identify potential additional experts to fill in these gaps. These experts will then be retroactively nominated following the approved procedure for <strong>filling gaps</strong> among groups of experts approved by the fourth session of the Plenary (see IPBES/4/19 and decision IPBES-4/3).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>MEP or Bureau members that would like to participate as an expert in an assessment can be nominated for such a role, but they will have to resign from their duties as an MEP or Bureau member when accepting the new role.</p>
<p>The co-chairs, CLAs, LAs, REs, Fellows and Contributing Authors (CAs) have different responsibilities within a particular IPBES assessment. Each role in an Assessments not only has a specific nomination process but also has different responsibilities within a particular IPBES assessment (see Table 2.1). These roles are further described in Table 2.2.</p>

If the pool of original nominations is not balanced enough, additional nominations can be initiated by the procedure for filling gaps among groups of experts (decision IPBES-4/3).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Nominations will be compiled in lists that are made available to all Platform members and other stakeholders, and will be maintained by the Platform secretariat.

A co-chair is senior in their field and has experience in coordinating the work of experts. Besides overseeing the development of the assessment, the co-chair can also contribute text to one (or more) chapters.</p>
<p>The co-chair is also responsible for collaborating with the coordinating lead authors to ensure that the chapters are delivered in a timely manner and with a high standard, and that they address the key scoping questions. The co-chair will ensure that the chapters feed into each other and that their messages are not contradicting.</p>
<p>The co-chair participates in the setting of the agenda and the chairing of the author meetings. He/ she will work together with the management committee of the assessment to ensure that issues within the assessment are being solved and that the assessment is prepared according to the decisions and guidelines of IPBES. Once the assessment and SPM are finalized, co-chairs will also engage in the outreach for those deliverables.</p>

<p>The review editors’ main tasks are: (i) to assist the MEP in identifying reviewers for the expert review process; (ii) ensure that all substantive expert and government review comments are afforded appropriate consideration; (iii) advise lead authors on how to handle contentious or controversial issues; and (iv) ensure that genuine controversies are adequately reflected in the text of the report concerned.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the final text of the report remains with the relevant CLAs and LAs.</p>
<p>Review editors must submit a written report to the MEP and, where appropriate, will be requested to attend a meeting convened by the MEP to communicate their findings from the review process and assist in finalizing summaries for policymakers and synthesis reports.

Box 2.1: Writing suggestions for assessment reports
</div>
<p>The suggestions below are based on comments received during the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment peer review process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss the problems and actions first. Any necessary background can come later in an appendix or in references to other sources.</li>
<li>Focus on definable measures/actions and avoid the passive voice. For example, policy professionals are likely to ignore statements like “there are reasons to believe some trends can be slowed or even reversed”. If there are some opportunities for reversal, state precisely what we believe they are to the best of our knowledge.</li>
<li>Statements like “...might have enormous ramifications for health and productivity...” may seem to be strong because of the word “enormous”, but they are actually politically impotent because of the word “might.” If data are used in the assessment, what do they say about what “is” happening? What can we recommend, based on the best available knowledge, about what actions would be effective?</li>
<li>A statements like “there is a long history of concern over the environmental effects of fishing in coastal habitats, but the vast scope of ecological degradation is only recently becoming apparent (citation)” is a case where something strong could be said but it is weakened by putting emphasis on the late arrival of this information and knowledge “becoming apparent”. It does not matter so much when the degradation was discovered, what matters is that it was. Cite the source and say “fishing practices are causing wide‑spread destruction”.</li>
<li>Do not use value-laden, flowery or colloquial language (e.g., “sleeping dragon”, “elephant in the room”, etc.).</li>
<li>Statements like “we do not yet have clear guidelines for achieving responsible, effective management of natural resources” could result in a legitimate policy response of “OK, so we’ll wait until we do”. Instead, the statement could be changed to recommend what needs to be done, such as, “if clear guidelines were developed, then…”.</li>
<li>Diverse formats and modes of communication, for example participatory maps, artwork and visual imagery, will be important for working with indigenous and local knowledge.</li>

<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assessment-by-experts"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Assessment by experts</h2>
<p>A majority of IPBES assessments will be undertaken over three years (see Figure 2.3) and the timeline for each assessment is agreed by the Plenary as part of the acceptance of the scoping report for the assessment.</p>
<p>The evaluation is undertaken by a geographically and gender balanced multidisciplinary group of independent experts selected on their credentials from among a group of nominees. Their interaction with government representatives, observers and stakeholders takes place at the initiation, scoping, reviewing and approval stages of the assessment.</p>
<p>Typically, an IPBES assessment process will consist of the development of different drafts of the technical report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotated outline</li>
<li>Zero order draft</li>
<li>First order draft (1<sup>st</sup> order draft)</li>
<li>Second order draft (2<sup>nd</sup> order draft)</li>
<li>Final draft</li>
</ul>
<p>The development of these drafts, including the executive summaries of the chapters and the SPM, follows the chapter outline and addresses the guidance and questions set out in the approved scoping report. This process is usually supported by three author meetings and different review periods before being presented for discussion at the Plenary (see Figure 2.3). It involves an iterative and collective expert evaluation of the state of knowledge, which entails the preparation and review of the following successive draft chapters and summaries.</p>

<p>Within an IPBES assessment there are two external review processes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Independent external peer review of the first order draft: Experts with relevant knowledge and credentials regarding the assessment, but not involved in the assessment, will be invited to critically review one or more chapters of the first order draft.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong><em>Provide expert advice:</em></strong> Seek the best scientific and technical guidance.<br>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Ensure comprehensive independent representation:</em></strong> Invite responses from all countries and stakeholder groups.<br>

<p>An executive summary is, in principle, located at the start of each chapter to outline its key findings.</p>
<p>These summaries are crucial to communicate the outcomes of the assessment to its primary audience: members of IPBES, governments, observers and all other stakeholders. The executive summaries also provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>confidence statements in support of each key finding (see section 2.3.6);</li>
<li>links to sections in the full chapters that contain relevant supporting evidence and literature (traceability of findings);</li>
<li>input to the SPM; and</li>
<li>an explicit link between the SPM key findings and the sections within the full technical report providing supporting evidence (a traceable, evidence ‘paper trail’).</li>
</ul>
<p>The SPMs need to be written clearly, concisely and using simple language. This will facilitate effective communication of the key findings. Executive summaries are technical in nature and are based on the analysis set out in the chapter. They are not the same as an abstract of a scientific paper, but they should be a synthesis analysis and collective expert judgement of the chapter’s findings. One of the key differences between the executive summaries and the SPM is moving from setting out the technical facts to blending and synthesizing the findings from different chapters into policy-relevant messages. A key finding in the SPM should be readily traceable back to a main finding(s) in an executive summary that in turn should be readily traceable back to a section(s) of the chapter text, which should be traceable, where appropriate, to the primary literature through references. References to the relevant executive summary statement within the SPM are included in curly brackets (e.g., {1.2}), see Box 2.2 for examples.</p>

Box 2.2: Examples (extracts) of key findings on the status and trends in pollinators and pollination from the IPBES Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production Assessment SPM
</div>
<p><strong>Many wild bees and butterflies have been declining in abundance, occurrence and diversity at local and regional scales in North-West Europe and North America (established but incomplete); data for other regions and pollinator groups are currently insufficient to draw general conclusions, although local declines have been reported.</strong> At a regional level, declines in the diversity of bees and pollinator-dependent wild plants have been recorded in highly industrialized regions of the world, particularly Western Europe and Eastern North America, over the last century (well established). […] In agricultural systems, the local abundance and diversity of wild bees have been found to decline strongly with distance from field margins and remnants of natural and semi natural habitat at scales of a few hundred metres (well established) {3.2.2, 3.2.3}. <em>Source: The Pollinators, Pollination and food production assessment SPM p21-23</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The number of managed western honey bee hives is increasing at the global scale, although seasonal colony loss is high in some European countries and in North America (well established) (figure SPM.5). Colony losses may not always result in irreversible declines, as losses can be mitigated by beekeepers splitting colonies to recover or even exceed seasonal losses</strong>. The seasonal loss of western honey bees in Europe and North America varies strongly by country, state and province and by year, but in recent decades (at least since the widespread introduction of Varroa) has often been higher than the 10-15 per cent that was previously regarded as normal (established but incomplete). Data for other regions of the world is largely lacking {2.4.2.3, 2.4.2.4, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5}. <em>Source: The Pollinators, Pollination and food production assessment SPM p.21</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commercial management, mass breeding, transport and trade in pollinators outside their original ranges have resulted in new invasions, transmission of pathogens and parasites and regional extinctions of native pollinator species (well established).</strong> Recently developed commercial rearing of bumble bee species for greenhouse and field crop pollination, and their introduction to continents outside of their original ranges, have resulted in biological invasions, pathogen transmission to native species and the decline of congeneric (sub-)species (established but incomplete). A well-documented case is the severe decline in and extirpation from many areas of its original range of the giant bumble bee, Bombus dahlbomii, since the introduction and spread of the European B. terrestris in southern South America (well established) {3.2.3, 3.3.3,3.4.32, 3.4.3}. The presence of managed honey bees and their escaped descendants (for example African honey bees in the Americas) have changed visitation patterns to the native plants in those regions (unresolved) {3.2.3, 3.3.2, 3.4.2, 3.4.3}. Better regulation of the movement of all species of managed pollinators around the world, and within countries, can limit the spread of parasites and pathogens to managed and wild pollinators alike and reduce the likelihood that pollinators will be introduced outside their native ranges and cause negative impacts (established but incomplete) {6.4.4.2}. <em>Source: The Pollinators, Pollination and food production assessment SPM, p.28</em></p>
</div>
<p>Chapter 1 of an IPBES assessment is often introductory in nature and reflects the scene-setting objective of this chapter. Therefore, its executive summary will differ slightly from the other chapters in having an executive summary based on ‘key messages’ rather than ‘key findings’.</p>
<p>As a guideline, each chapter should preferably aim for an executive summary of up to 10-12 key findings and no more than 1,500 words. This will also vary depending on the nature of the chapter. The final IPBES pollination assessment wrote between 4- 21 key findings for each chapter (an average of 12 key findings per chapter). An example of a key finding from an executive summary of a chapter can be found in Box 2.3.</p>

<p>When we talk about confidence in assessments in relation to knowledge, we are referring to how assured experts are about the findings (data and information) presented within their chapters. Low confidence describes a situation where we have incomplete knowledge and therefore cannot fully explain an outcome or reliably predict a future outcome, whereas high confidence conveys that we have extensive knowledge and are able to explain an outcome or predict a future outcome with much greater certainty.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-does-our-communication-of-confidence-matter-in-ipbes-assessments"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Why does our communication of confidence matter in IPBES assessments?</h3>
<p>Knowledge and scientific data about the natural world and the influence of human activities are complex. There is a need to communicate what the assessment author teams have high confidence in as well as what requires further investigation to allow decision-makers to make informed decisions. Furthermore, by following a common approach when applying confidence terminology within an assessment, authors are able to increase consistency and transparency.</p>
<p>IPBES assessments will use specific phrases known as “confidence terms” in order to ensure consistency in the communication of confidence by author teams. What confidence term is used will depend on the author team’s expert judgement on the quantity and quality of the supporting evidence and the level of scientific agreement. IPBES assessments use a four-box model of confidence (see Figure 2.5) based on evidence and agreements that give four main confidence terms: “well established” (much evidence and high agreement), “unresolved” (much evidence but low agreement), “established but incomplete” (limited evidence but good agreement) and “inconclusive” (limited or no evidence and little agreement).</p>
<p>The following guidance will discuss where confidence terms must be applied in the IPBES assessment reports, how to select the appropriate term to communicate the author team’s confidence and how to present the confidence terms in the text.</p>
<p>Confidence terms should always be used in two key parts of an assessment: 1. They should be assigned to the key findings in the <strong>executive summaries</strong> of the technical chapters in an assessment report (see Box 2.2), and 2. For both key messages and key findings of the SPMs (see Box 2.3).</p>

<p>Once the author team has identified the chapter’s key messages and findings, in order to present these in the <strong>executive summary</strong> or <strong>SPM</strong>, it is mandatory to evaluate the quality and quantity of associated evidence and scientific agreement. Author teams will always be required to make qualitative <strong>assessments</strong> of confidence based on expert estimates of agreements and evidence.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the evidence supporting the key message or finding, <strong>quantitative assessments</strong> of confidence may also be possible. Quantitative assessments of confidence are estimates of the likelihood (probability) that a well-defined outcome will occur in the future. Probabilistic estimates are based on statistical analyses of observations or model results, or both, combined with expert judgment. However, it may be that quantitative assessments of confidence are not possible in all assessments due to the nature of the evidence available.</p>
<p>It is not mandatory to apply confidence terms throughout the main text of the assessment report. However, in some parts of the main text, in areas where there are a range of views that need to be described, confidence terms may be applied where considered appropriate by the author team. In order to avoid confusing readers, in no case should the terms be used colloquially or casually. Use these terms if you have followed the recommended steps for assessing confidence.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qualitative-assessment-of-confidence"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Qualitative assessment of confidence</h3>
<p>This section discusses the process and language that all author teams must apply to evaluate and communicate confidence qualitatively. The following factors should be considered to evaluate the validity of the message or finding: the type, quantity, quality and consistency of evidence (the existing peer‑reviewed literature and grey literature, etc.), as well as the level of agreement (the level of concurrence in the data, literature and amongst experts, not just across the author team). The author team’s expert judgement on the level of evidence and agreement should then be used to apply a confidence term as described in Figure 2.4:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Inconclusive</em></strong> – existing as or based on a suggestion or speculation; no or limited evidence.</li>
<li><strong><em>Unresolved</em></strong> – multiple independent studies exist but conclusions do not agree.</li>
<li><strong><em>Established but incomplete</em></strong> – general agreement although only a limited number of studies exist but with no comprehensive synthesis, or the studies that do exist imprecisely address the question.</li>
<li><strong><em>Well established</em></strong> – comprehensive meta-analysis or other syntheses/multiple independent studies that agree.</li>
</ul>

Note: ‘well-established’ can be further subdivided into ‘very well established’ and ‘virtually certain’.<br>
<em>Source: IPBES, 2016.</em></p>
<p>The <strong><em>well-established</em></strong> box in Figure 2.4 may be further subdivided in order to give author teams the flexibility to emphasize key messages and findings that the author team have very high confidence in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Very well established</em></strong> – very comprehensive evidence base and very low amount of disagreement.</li>
<li><strong><em>Virtually certain</em></strong> – very robust data covering multiple temporal and spatial scales and almost no disagreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The qualitative confidence terms discussed in this section should not be interpreted probabilistically and are distinct from “statistical significance”.</p>
<p><strong><em>Virtually certain</em></strong> will not be used by the author teams frequently in the assessment report. The confidence terms used to communicate high confidence are intended to provide authors with the flexibility to emphasize issues that may be considered as fact by the scientific community but not by the non-scientific community (decision-makers, media and the general public). In most cases it may be appropriate to describe these findings using overwhelming evidence and agreements as statements of fact without using confidence qualifiers.</p>
<p>Similarly, <strong><em>inconclusive</em></strong> may also be used infrequently, but is intended to provide authors with the flexibility to emphasize issues that are not established in science but that are important to policymakers or might have been highlighted by a different audience.</p>
<p>The degree of confidence in findings that are conditional on other findings should be evaluated and reported separately.</p>
<p>When evaluating the levels of evidence and agreements for a statement, it is important to standardize the use of the terms within and across the author teams and, when possible, across the assessment in order to ensure their consistent use. The use of the discussed confidence terms can be standardized by taking key messages and findings in the <strong>executive summaries</strong> and discussing, as an author team, what terms should be applied and the reasons why. When appropriate, consider using formal elicitation methods to organize and quantify the selection of confidence terms.</p>
<p>Be aware of the tendency for a group to converge on an expressed view and become overconfident in it. One method to avoid this would be to ask each member of the author team to write down his or her individual assessment of the level of confidence before entering into a group discussion. If this is not done before a group discussion, important views and ranges of confidence may be inadequately discussed and assessed. It is important to recognize when individual views are adjusting as a result of group interactions and allow adequate time for such changes in viewpoint to be reviewed (Mastrandrea et al.&nbsp;2010). Whichever approach is taken, traceable accounts should be produced and recorded to demonstrate how confidence was evaluated.</p>
<p>It is important to carefully consider how the sentences in the key messages and findings are structured because it will influence the clarity with which we communicate our understanding of the level of confidence. For example, sometimes the key finding combines an element that is <strong><em>well-established</em></strong> with one that is <strong><em>established but incomplete</em></strong>. In this case it can be helpful to arrange the phrasing so that the <strong><em>well-established</em></strong> element comes first and the <strong><em>established but incomplete</em></strong> element comes second, or as a separate sentence. Avoid the use of <strong><em>unresolved</em></strong> and <strong><em>established but incomplete</em></strong> where possible by writing or rewording key messages and findings in terms of what is known rather than unknown. Author teams should focus on presenting what is <strong><em>well-established</em></strong> as far as possible in order to make it clear to decision-makers what is known. Assigning confidence terms to our key findings will therefore often require that we re-write sentences, rather than simply adding the terms to existing text.</p>

<p>This section discusses the process and language that author teams may wish to apply in order to evaluate and communicate the confidence that an outcome will occur quantitatively. Likelihood expresses a probabilistic estimate of the occurrence of a single event or of an outcome within a given range. Probabilistic estimates are based on statistical analyses of observations or model results, or both, combined with expert judgment.</p>
<p>When sufficient probabilistic information is available, consider ranges of outcomes and their associated probabilities with attention to outcomes of potential high consequence. The author team’s expert judgement on the magnitude of the probability should then be used to apply a likelihood term (see Figure 2.5).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><strong>Figure 2.5. Likelihood scale for the quantitative communication of the probability of an outcome occurring</strong><br>
<br>
Note: Extreme levels of probability are nested within the broader levels of “likely” and “unlikely”.&nbsp;<em>Source: modified from Mastrandrea et al.&nbsp;2010.</em></p>
<p>Categories in Figure 2.5 can be considered to have nested boundaries. For example, describing an outcome as <strong><em>likely</em></strong> or <strong><em>very likely</em></strong> conveys in both cases that the probability of this outcome could fall within the range of 95% to 100% probability. However, in the case of <strong><em>likely</em></strong>, the larger range (66-100%) indicates a higher degree of confidence than <strong><em>very likely</em></strong> (90-100%). In making their expert judgement, author teams should start at <strong><em>about as likely as not</em></strong> and consider whether there is sufficient quantitative information available to assign either a <strong><em>likely</em></strong> or <strong><em>unlikely</em></strong> probability range. Only after thinking about this initial range should the author teams consider whether there is sufficient evidence to move to more extreme levels of probability.</p>
<p>Author teams should note that using a likelihood term for a specific outcome implies that alternative outcomes have the inverse likelihood, e.g., if an outcome is <strong><em>likely</em></strong> (a range of 66-100%) then that would imply that other outcomes are <strong><em>unlikely</em></strong> (0-33% probability).</p>
<p>If the author team consider that sufficiently robust information is available with which to make a ‘best estimate’ of the probability of the occurrence of an event, then it is preferable to specify the full probability range (e.g., 90-95%) in the text without using the terms in Figure 2.5. Also, <strong><em>about as likely as not</em></strong> should not be used to communicate a lack of knowledge, only as an estimate of probability based on the available information.</p>
<p>Author teams should be aware of the way in which key messages and findings are phrased. The way in which a statement is framed will have an effect on how it is interpreted, e.g., a 10% chance of dying is interpreted more negatively than a 90% chance of surviving. Consider reciprocal statements to avoid value-laden interpretations, e.g., report chances of both dying and surviving (Mastrandrea et al.&nbsp;2010).</p>
<p>Finally, author teams should try not to avoid controversial events, such as impacts or events with high consequence but extremely low probability, in their effort to achieve consensus within an author team.</p>

<p>Confidence terms are communicated as part of the key findings of an assessment. The key findings are set out in the <strong>executive summaries</strong> for each of the assessment’s chapters in the full technical report. The key findings are the facts and information drawn directly from the chapter. It is recommended that key findings should be set out as follows.</p>
<p><strong>The first sentence of the finding should be bolded</strong> and contain a confidence term from the four-box model in italics and brackets at the end of the sentence. This first sentence is followed by two to four sentences which then supports the information contained in this first sentence. Subsequent sentences may contain confidence terms within brackets where appropriate. It is not necessary to include confidence terms with each sentence if the whole paragraph falls under the same confidence term.</p>
<p>The words that make up the four-box model and likelihood scale should <u>not</u> be used in the text of the assessment except when formally assigning confidence. If, for example, there was a sentence that used the word “likely” but not with the intended meaning from the likelihood scale, then the word should be replaced with another (e.g., probably).</p>

<p>In some instances, author teams may wish to complement the use of the <strong><em>well-established</em></strong> confidence term with a term from the likelihood scale. If terms from the likelihood scale are used then they should be incorporated into the text and italicized prior to the impact or outcome of the probability of which they are describing.</p>

<p>The author team’s expert judgment of their confidence in the key messages and findings should be explained by providing a clear traceable account. A traceable account is a description in the chapter of the evaluation of the type, quantity, quality and consistency of the evidence and level of agreement that forms the basis for the given key message or finding (Mastrandrea et al.&nbsp;2010). Where possible, the description should identify and discuss the sources of confidence. In order to ensure consistency in how the author teams classify sources of confidence within and across IPBES assessments, author teams should use the typology shown in Table 2.5.</p>
<p>A main finding in the <strong>summary for policymakers</strong> should be readily traceable back to an <strong>executive summary</strong> main finding(s) that in turn should be readily traceable back to a section(s) of the chapter text, which should be traceable, where appropriate, to the primary literature through references.</p>
<p>References to the relevant <strong>executive summary</strong> statement in the SPM should be included in curly brackets (e.g., {1.2}), see Box 2.2.</p>

<p>The steps recommended for assessing and communicating confidence for executive summaries and SPMs is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Identify the chapter’s key messages and findings.</li>
<li>Evaluate the supporting evidence and the level of scientific agreement.</li>
<li>Establish whether the evidence is probabilistic or not (e.g., from model predictions).</li>
<li>Where the evidence is qualitative instead or probabilistic, select a confidence term from the <strong>four-box model</strong> (see Figure 2.4) to communicate the author team’s confidence in the key message or finding.
<ol type="a">
<li>Assess the quantity and quality of evidence and the level of agreement in the scientific community.</li>
<li>Establish how confident the author team is and select the appropriate term.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Where quantitative estimates of the probability of an outcome or impact occurring are available (e.g., from model predictions), select a likelihood term from the <strong>likelihood scale</strong> (see Table 2.5) to communicate the author teams’ expert judgement of the range of the probability of occurrence.</li>
<li>Ensure that there is always a ‘traceable account’ in the main text describing how the author team adopted the specific level of confidence, including the important lines of evidence used, the standard of evidence applied and the approaches to combine/reconcile multiple lines of evidence. Where specific sources of confidence are prominent for a key finding, the terms used in the left-hand column of Table 2.5 should be included in the traceable account.</li>
<li>Optional: Consider using formal frameworks for assessing expert judgements for each author team.</li>

<p>A summary for policymakers (SPM) is a short document that highlights the main messages of an assessment responding to its scoping report in a synthesized and less technical language, and tailored to the needs of policymakers. It consists of preferably 15-20 top key messages (2,000 words max) categorized under a few headings and presented without reference to the main chapters. They represent the highest level of synthesis of the assessment and may be structured differently from the set of main findings in the SPM. Each message is carefully formulated in a bolded sentence with assigned confidence levels and is supported by a paragraph of non-bolded text which substantiates the message (see Box 2.4).</p>
<div class="boxed">
<div id="box1-3" class="boxed-title">
Box 2.4: Examples (extracts) of key messages from the IPBES Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production Assessment SPM
</div>
<p><strong>6. The vast majority of pollinator species are wild, including more than 20,000 species of bees, some species of flies, butterflies, moths, wasps, beetles, thrips, birds, bats and other vertebrates. A few species of bees are widely managed, including the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), the eastern honey bee (Apis cerana), some bumble bees, some stingless bees and a few solitary bees</strong>. Beekeeping provides an important source of income for many rural livelihoods. The western honey bee is the most widespread managed pollinator in the world, and globally there are about 81 million hives producing an estimated 1.6 million tonnes of honey. |</p>
<p><strong>11. The number of managed western honey bee hives has increased globally over the last five decades, even though declines have been recorded in some European countries and North America over the same period</strong>. Seasonal colony loss of western honey bees has in recent years been high at least in some parts of the temperate Northern Hemisphere and in South Africa. Beekeepers can under some conditions, with associated economic costs, make up such losses through the splitting of managed colonies.</p>
<p><strong>1. The abundance, diversity and health of pollinators and the provision of pollination are threatened by direct drivers that generate risks to societies and ecosystems</strong>. Threats include land‑use change, intensive agricultural management and pesticide use, environmental pollution, invasive alien species, pathogens and climate change. Explicitly linking pollinator declines to individual or combinations of direct drivers is limited by data availability or complexity, yet a wealth of individual case studies worldwide suggests that these direct drivers often affect pollinators negatively.</p>
<p><strong>20. Most agricultural genetically modified organisms (GMOs) carry traits for herbicide tolerance (HT) or insect resistance (IR).</strong> Reduced weed populations are likely to accompany most herbicide-tolerant (HT) crops, diminishing food resources for pollinators. The actual consequences for the abundance and diversity of pollinators foraging in herbicide-tolerant (HT)-crop fields is unknown. Insect-resistant (IR) crops can result in the reduction of insecticide use, which varies regionally according to the prevalence of pests, the emergence of secondary outbreaks of non-target pests or primary pest resistance. If sustained, the reduction in insecticide use could reduce pressure on nontarget insects. How insect-resistant (IR) crop use and reduced pesticide use affect pollinator abundance and diversity is unknown. Risk assessments required for the approval of genetically‑modified organism (GMO) crops in most countries do not adequately address the direct sublethal effects of insect-resistant (IR) crops or the indirect effects of herbicide-tolerant (HT) and insect-resistant (IR) crops, partly because of a lack of data.</p>
</div>
<p>The key messages of the SPM aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>tell a short, coherent and compelling story on the state of knowledge aimed at non‑technical decision-makers and the public;</li>
<li>convey illustrative and striking perspectives, facts and numbers from the assessment;</li>
<li>set the stage for the negotiation of the SPM at the IPBES Plenary; and</li>
<li>serve as a key source for media and outreach material once approved by the Plenary.</li>
</ul>
<p>These messages are followed by a set of main findings categorized under a set of headings (approximately 10,000 words max). They tell a comprehensive story, based on the state of knowledge specific to the scoping document, and are aimed at non-technical decision-makers but with higher levels of technical yet non-jargon specificity compared to the top key messages (see Box 2.4).</p>
<p>Each finding is formulated in one or two bolded sentences, substantiated and supported with statements amounting to one paragraph of text. The statements in the messages are assigned confidence levels and often start with the ones that have highest confidence. Findings can be traced back to the underlining chapter section(s) from which they are drawn.</p>
<p>The responsibility for preparing the first and revised drafts of the SPMs lies with the report co-chairs and an appropriate representation of CLAs and LAss, with a review process overseen by the MEP and Bureau.</p>
<p>The features of an SPM are that it:</p>
<ul>
<li>sets out policy relevant messages from the assessment while not being policy prescriptive, and</li>
<li>builds on the executive summaries (key findings) from each chapter from the technical assessment report.</li>
</ul>
<p>The development of an SPM is an iterative process as explained in the following section . You will need to make sure that the information in each chapter’s executive summary underpins the messages set out in the SPM and that the analyses in the assessment chapters support the findings in the executive summaries. Fundamentally, no information, data or knowledge should appear in the SPM if it does not appear in the technical assessment report.</p>
<p>Important points to recognize from the Pollination Assessment SPM:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a total of 11 key findings that are short and indicated in bold.</li>
<li>Each key finding comes with a confidence language statement (in parentheses).</li>
<li>Further explanations for the key findings are provided via additional text about a paragraph in length each.</li>
<li>The total word count is around 1,400.</li>
<li>Each key finding includes a list of the chapter sections that contain the relevant literature/evidence supporting it.</li>
<li>SPMs of methodological assessments may contain guidance points, which are lessons from best practices for building greater understanding and strengthening approaches to and making more effective use of methodological themes (see for example the Scenarios and Models Assessment SPM).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
<li>In the context of IPBES, <strong>policy support tools and methodologies</strong> may be defined as approaches based on science and other knowledge systems that can inform, assist and enhance relevant decisions, policymaking and implementation at local, national, regional and global levels in order to protect nature, thereby promoting nature’s contributions to people and a good quality of life (IPBES core glossary).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></li>

<h3 data-number="7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="steps-to-developing-an-spm"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Steps to developing an SPM</h3>
<p><em>Step 1: Developing executive summaries</em> The first step in developing an SPM is the development of an executive summary for each chapter. The executive summaries set out the key findings with the appropriate confidence terms for a particular chapter (see section 2.2.6.8 for further guidance on applying confidence terms). The content of the executive summary should be technical in nature and based on the analysis set out in the chapter.</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Identify the policy-relevant messages</em> One of the key differences between the executive summaries and the SPM is moving from the process of setting out technical facts to blending and synthesizing the findings from different chapters into policy-relevant messages. These messages aim to tell a short, coherent and compelling story on the state of knowledge (see Box 2.5).</p>
<p>This stage is critical for fine-tuning the articulation of key findings and policy-relevant messages in the SPM, developing graphics, quality assurance of chapters, and ensuring consistency and traceability of confidence statements between the SPM and chapters. The drafts are process‑validated by the MEP and Bureau and are presented by the secretariat to the Plenary during Stage 3 – approval and acceptance of the final assessment report.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The SPM for the IPBES assessments are approved line by line within the Plenary, therefore it is important to develop a succinct summary based upon the analysis of the assessment. Use confidence terminology to ensure that no ambiguity appears with regards to the messages and analyses in the SPM. Each finding should also contain a footnote with a reference back to the number of the section or sections of the main report that the finding is drawn from.</p>
